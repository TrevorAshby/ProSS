three rings for the elven - kings under the sky ,                seven for the dwarf - lords in their halls of stone ,             nine for mortal men doomed to die ,               one for the dark

them           in the land of mordor where the shadows lieforewordthis tale grew in the telling ,  until it became a history of the great war of the ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded itit was begun soon after the hobbit was written and before its publication in 1937 ;  but i did not go on with this sequel ,  for i wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the elder days ,  which had then been taking shape for some yearsi desired to do this for my own satisfaction ,  and i had little hope that other people would be interested in this work ,  especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of  ' history '  for elvish tongueswhen those whose advice and opinion i sought corrected little hope to no hope ,  i went back to the sequel ,  encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits and their adventuresbut the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world ,  and became an account ,  as it were ,  of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been toldthe process had begun in the writing of the hobbit ,  in which there were already some references to the older matter :  elrond ,  gondolin ,  the high - elves ,  and the orcs ,  as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface :  durin ,  moria ,  gandalf ,  the necromancer ,  the ringthe discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the third age and its culmination in the war of the ringthose who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it ,  but they had to wait a long time ;  for the composition of the lord of the rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949 ,  a period in which i had many duties that i did not neglect ,  and many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed methe delay was ,  of course ,  also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939 ,  by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of book onein spite of the darkness of the next five years i found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned ,  and i plodded on ,  mostly by night ,  till i stood by balin ' s tomb in moriathere i halted for a long whileit was almost a year later when i went on and so came to lothlûrien and the great river late in 1941in the next year i wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as book three ,  and the beginnings of chapters i and iii of book five ;  and there as the beacons flared in anûrien and thèoden came to harrowdale i stoppedforesight had failed and there was no time for thoughtit was during 1944 that ,  leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct ,  or at least to report ,  1 forced myself to tackle the journey of frodo to mordorthese chapters ,  eventually to become book four ,  were written and sent out as a serial to my son ,  christopher ,  then in south africa with the rafnonetheless it took another five years before the tale was brought to its present end ;  in that time i changed my house ,  my chair ,  and my college ,  and the days though less dark were no less laboriousthen when the  ' end '  had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised ,  and indeed largely re - written backwardsand it had to be typed ,  and re - typed :  by me ;  the cost of professional typing by the ten - fingered was beyond my meansthe lord of the rings has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print ;  and i should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that i have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the talethe prime motive was the desire of a tale - teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers ,  amuse them ,  delight them ,  and at times maybe excite them or deeply move themas a guide i had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving ,  and for many the guide was inevitably often at faultsome who have read the book ,  or at any rate have reviewed it ,  have found it boring ,  absurd ,  or contemptible ;  and i have no cause to complain ,  since i have similar opinions of their works ,  or of the kinds of writing that they evidently preferbut even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to pleaseit is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points ,  nor to displease everybody at the same points ;  for i find from the letters that i have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approvedthe most critical reader of all ,  myself ,  now finds many defects ,  minor and major ,  but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again ,  he will pass over these in silence ,  except one that has been noted by others :  the book is too shortas for any inner meaning or  ' message '  ,  it has in the intention of the author noneit is neither allegorical nor topicalas the story grew it put down roots  ( into the past )  and threw out unexpected branches :  but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the ring as the link between it and the hobbitthe crucial chapter ,   " the shadow of the past '  ,  is one of the oldest parts of the taleit was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster ,  and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines ,  if that disaster had been avertedits sources are things long before in mind ,  or in some cases already written ,  and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequelsthe real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusionif it had inspired or directed the development of the legend ,  then certainly the ring would have been seized and used against sauron ;  he would not have been annihilated but enslaved ,  and barad - d˚r would not have been destroyed but occupiedsaruman ,  failing to get possession of the ring ,  would m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in mordor the missing links in his own researches into ring - lore ,  and before long he would have made a great ring of his own with which to challenge the self - styled ruler of middle - earthin that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt :  they would not long have survived even as slavesother arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical referencebut i cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations ,  and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presencei much prefer history ,  true or feigned ,  with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readersi think that many confuse  ' applicability '  with  ' allegory '  ;  but the one resides in the freedom of the reader ,  and the other in the purposed domination of the authoran author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience ,  but the ways in which a story - germ uses the soil of experience are extremely complex ,  and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguousit is also false ,  though naturally attractive ,  when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped ,  to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful influencesone has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression ;  but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following yearsby 1918 all but one of my close friends were deador to take a less grievous matter :  it has been supposed by some that  ' the scouring of the shire '  reflects the situation in england at the time when i was finishing my taleit does notit is an essential part of the plot ,  foreseen from the outset ,  though in the event modified by the character of saruman as developed in the story without ,  need i say ,  any allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoeverit has indeed some basis in experience ,  though slender  ( for the economic situation was entirely different )  ,  and much further backthe country in which i lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before i was ten ,  in days when motor - cars were rare objects  ( i had never seen one )  and men were still building suburban railwaysrecently i saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving corn - mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so importanti never liked the looks of the young miller ,  but his father ,  the old miller ,  had a black beard ,  and he was not named sandymanthe lord of the rings is now issued in a new edition ,  and the opportunity has been taken of revising ita number of errors and inconsistencies that still remained in the text have been corrected ,  and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive readers have raisedi have considered all their comments and enquiries ,  and if some seem to have been passed over that may be because i have failed to keep my notes in order ;  but many enquiries could only be answered by additional appendices ,  or indeed by the production of an accessory volume containing much of the material that i did not include in the original edition ,  in particular more detailed linguistic informationin the meantime this edition offers this foreword ,  an addition to the prologue ,  some notes ,  and an index of the names of persons and placesthis index is in intention complete in items but not in references ,  since for the present purpose it has been necessary to reduce its bulka complete index ,  making full use of the material prepared for me by mrssmith ,  belongs rather to the accessory volumeprologuethis book is largely concerned with hobbits ,  and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their historyfurther information will also be found in the selection from the red book of westmarch that has already been published ,  under the title of the hobbitthat story was derived from the earlier chapters of the red book ,  composed by bilbo himself ,  the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large ,  and called by him there and back again ,  since they told of his journey into the east and his return :  an adventure which later involved all the hobbits in the great events of that age that are here relatedmany ,  however ,  may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset ,  while some may not possess the earlier bookfor such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from hobbit - lore ,  and the first adventure is briefly recalledhobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people ,  more numerous formerly than they are today ;  for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth :  a well - ordered and well - farmed countryside was their favourite hauntthey do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge - bellows ,  a water - mill ,  or a hand - loom ,  though they were skilful with toolseven in ancient days they were ,  as a rule ,  shy of  ' the big folk '  ,  as they call us ,  and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to findthey are quick of hearing and sharp - eyed ,  and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily ,  they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movementsthey possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently ,  when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by ;  and this an they have developed until to men it may seem magicalbut hobbits have never ,  in fact ,  studied magic of any kind ,  and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice ,  and a close friendship with the earth ,  have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier racesfor they are a little people ,  smaller than dwarves :  less tout and stocky ,  that is ,  even when they are not actually much shortertheir height is variable ,  ranging between two and four feet of our measurethey seldom now reach three feet ;  but they hive dwindled ,  they say ,  and in ancient days they were talleraccording to the red book ,  bandobras took  ( bullroarer )  ,  son of isengrim the second ,  was four foot five and able to ride a horsehe was surpassed in all hobbit records only by two famous characters of old ;  but that curious matter is dealt with in this bookas for the hobbits of the shire ,  with whom these tales are concerned ,  in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folkthey dressed in bright colours ,  being notably fond of yellow and green ;  but they seldom wore shoes ,  since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair ,  much like the hair of their heads ,  which was commonly brownthus ,  the only craft little practised among them was shoe - making ;  but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely thingstheir faces were as a rule good - natured rather than beautiful ,  broad ,  bright - eyed ,  red - cheeked ,  with mouths apt to laughter ,  and to eating and drinkingand laugh they did ,  and eat ,  and drink ,  often and heartily ,  being fond of simple jests at all times ,  and of six meals a day  ( when they could get them )they were hospitable and delighted in parties ,  and in presents ,  which they gave away freely and eagerly acceptedit is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement hobbits are relatives of ours :  far nearer to us than elves ,  or even than dwarvesof old they spoke the languages of men ,  after their own fashion ,  and liked and disliked much the same things as men didbut what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discoveredthe beginning of hobbits lies far back in the elder days that are now lost and forgottenonly the elves still preserve any records of that vanished time ,  and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history ,  in which men appear seldom and hobbits are not mentioned at allyet it is clear that hobbits had ,  in fact ,  lived quietly in middle - earth for many long years before other folk became even aware of themand the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count ,  these little people seemed of very little importancebut in the days of bilbo ,  and of frodo his heir ,  they suddenly became ,  by no wish of their own ,  both important and renowned ,  and troubled the counsels of the wise and the greatthose days ,  the third age of middle - earth ,  are now long past ,  and the shape of all lands has been changed ;  but the regions in which hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger :  the north - west of the old world ,  east of the seaof their original home the hobbits in bilbo ' s time preserved no knowledgea love of learning  ( other than genealogical lore )  was far from general among them ,  but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books ,  and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from elves ,  dwarves ,  and mentheir own records began only after the settlement of the shire ,  and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their wandering daysit is clear ,  nonetheless ,  from these legends ,  and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs ,  that like many other folk hobbits had in the distant past moved westwardtheir earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of anduin ,  between the eaves of greenwood the great and the misty mountainswhy they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into eriador is no longer certaintheir own accounts speak of the multiplying of men in the land ,  and of a shadow that fell on the forest ,  so that it became darkened and its new name was mirkwoodbefore the crossing of the mountains the hobbits had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds :  harfoots ,  stoors ,  and fallohidesthe harfoots were browner of skin ,  smaller ,  and shorter ,  and they were beardless and bootless ;  their hands and feet were neat and nimble ;  and they preferred highlands and hillsidesthe stoors were broader ,  heavier in build ;  their feet and hands were larger ,  and they preferred flat lands and riversidesthe fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair ,  and they were taller and slimmer than the others ;  they were lovers of trees and of woodlandsthe harfoots had much to do with dwarves in ancient times ,  and long lived in the foothills of the mountainsthey moved westward early ,  and roamed over eriador as far as weathertop while the others were still in the wilderlandthey were the most normal and representative variety of hobbit ,  and far the most numerousthey were the most inclined to settle in one place ,  and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holesthe stoors lingered long by the banks of the great river anduin ,  and were less shy of menthey came west after the harfoots and followed the course of the loudwater southwards ;  and there many of them long dwelt between tharbad and the borders of dunland before they moved north againthe fallohides ,  the least numerous ,  were a northerly branchthey were more friendly with elves than the other hobbits were ,  and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts ;  and of old they preferred hunting to tillingthey crossed the mountains north of rivendell and came down the river hoarwellin eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them ,  but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous ,  they were often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of harfoots or stoorseven in bilbo ' s time the strong fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families ,  such as the tooks and the masters of bucklandin the westlands of eriador ,  between the misty mountains and the mountains of lune ,  the hobbits found both men and elvesindeed ,  a remnant still dwelt there of the d˙nedain ,  the kings of men that came over the sea out of westernesse ;  but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their north kingdom were falling far and wide into wastethere was room and to spare for incomers ,  and ere long the hobbits began to settle in ordered communitiesmost of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in bilbo ' s time ;  but one of the first to become important still endured ,  though reduced in size ;  this was at bree and in the chetwood that lay round about ,  some forty miles east of the shireit was in these early days ,  doubtless ,  that the hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the d˙nedain ,  who had in their turn long before learned the art from the elvesand in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before ,  and spoke ever after the common speech ,  the westron as it was named ,  that was current through all the lands of the kings from arnor to gondor ,  and about all the coasts of the sea from belfalas to luneyet they kept a few words of their own ,  as well as their own names of months and days ,  and a great store of personal names out of the pastabout this time legend among the hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of yearsfor it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the third age that the fallohide brothers ,  marcho and blanco ,  set out from bree ;  and having obtained permission from the high king at fornost ,  they crossed the brown river baranduin with a great following of hobbitsthey passed over the bridge of stonebows ,  that had been built in the days of the power of the north kingdom ,  and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in ,  between the river and the far downsall that was demanded of them was that they should keep the great bridge in repair ,  and all other bridges and roads ,  speed the king ' s messengers ,  and acknowledge his lordshipthus began the shire - reckoning ,  for the year of the crossing of the brandywine  ( as the hobbits turned the name )  became year one of the shire ,  and all later dates were reckoned from itat once the western hobbits fell in love with their new land ,  and they remained there ,  and soon passed once more out of the history of men and of elveswhile there was still a king they were in name his subjects ,  but they were ,  in fact ,  ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outsideto the last battle at fornost with the witch - lord of angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king ,  or so they maintained ,  though no tales of men record itbut in that war the north kingdom ended ;  and then the hobbits took the land for their own ,  and they chose from their own chiefs a thain to hold the authority of the king that was gonethere for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars ,  and they prospered and multiplied after the dark plague  ( smany thousands then perished ,  but the days of dearth  ( 1158 - 60 )  were at the time of this tale long past and the hobbits had again become accustomed to plentythe land was rich and kindly ,  and though it had long been deserted when they entered it ,  it had before been well tilled ,  and there the king had once had many farms ,  cornlands ,  vineyards ,  and woodsforty leagues it stretched from the far downs to the brandywine bridge ,  and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the souththe hobbits named it the shire ,  as the region of the authority of their thain ,  and a district of well - ordered business ;  and there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied their well - ordered business of living ,  and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved ,  until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in middle - earth and the right of all sensible folkthey forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the guardians ,  and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the shirethey were ,  in fact ,  sheltered ,  but they had ceased to remember itat no time had hobbits of any kind been warlike ,  and they had never fought among themselvesin olden days they had ,  of course ,  been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world ;  but in bilbo ' s time that was very ancient historythe last battle ,  before this story opens ,  and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the shire ,  was beyond living memory :  the battle of greenfields ,  seven the weathers had grown milder ,  and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the north in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather ' s taleso ,  though there was still some store of weapons in the shire ,  these were used mostly as trophies ,  hanging above hearths or on walls ,  or gathered into the museum at michel delvingthe mathom - house it was called ;  for anything that hobbits had no immediate use for ,  but were unwilling to throw away ,  they called a mathomtheir dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms ,  and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that sonnonetheless ,  ease and peace had left this people still curiously toughthey were ,  if it came to it ,  difficult to daunt or to kill ;  and they were ,  perhaps ,  so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could ,  when put to it ,  do without them ,  and could survive rough handling by grief ,  foe ,  or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well - fed facesthough slow to quarrel ,  and for sport killing nothing that lived ,  they were doughty at bay ,  and at need could still handle armsthey shot well with the bow ,  for they were keen - eyed and sure at the marknot only with bows and arrowsif any hobbit stooped for a stone ,  it was well to get quickly under cover ,  as all trespassing beasts knew very wellall hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground ,  or so they believed ,  and in such dwellings they still felt most at home ;  but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abodeactually in the shire in bilbo ' s days it was ,  as a rule ,  only the richest and the poorest hobbits that maintained the old customthe poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind ,  mere holes indeed ,  with only one window or none ;  while the well - to - do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of oldbut suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels  ( or smials as they called them )  were not everywhere to be found ;  and in the flats and the low - lying districts the hobbits ,  as they multiplied ,  began to build above groundindeed ,  even in the hilly regions and the older villages ,  such as hobbiton or tuckborough ,  or in the chief township of the shire ,  michel delving on the white downs ,  there were now many houses of wood ,  brick ,  or stonethese were specially favoured by millers ,  smiths ,  ropers ,  and cartwrights ,  and others of that sort ;  for even when they had holes to live inhobbits had long been accustomed to build sheds and workshopsthe habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the marish down by the brandywinethe hobbits of that quarter ,  the eastfarthing ,  were rather large and heavy - legged ,  and they wore dwarf - boots in muddy weatherbut they were well known to be stoors in a large part of their blood ,  as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chinsno harfoot or fallohide had any trace of a beardindeed ,  the folk of the marish ,  and of buckland ,  east of the river ,  which they afterwards occupied ,  came for the most part later into the shire up from south - away ;  and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the shireit is probable that the craft of building ,  as many other crafts beside ,  was derived from the d˙nedainbut the hobbits may have learned it direct from the elves ,  the teachers of men in their youthfor the elves of the high kindred had not yet forsaken middle - earth ,  and they dwelt still at that time at the grey havens away to the west ,  and in other places within reach of the shirethree elf - towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the tower hills beyond the western marchesthey shone far off in the moonlightthe tallest was furthest away ,  standing alone upon a green moundthe hobbits of the westfarthing said that one could see the sea from the lop of that tower ;  but no hobbit had ever been known to climb itindeed ,  few hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the sea ,  and fewer still had ever returned to report itmost hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings ,  and not many of them could swimand as the days of the shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the elves ,  and grew afraid of them ,  and distrustful of those that had dealings with them ;  and the sea became a word of fear among them ,  and a token of death ,  and they turned their faces away from the hills in the westthe craft of building may have come from elves or men ,  but the hobbits used it in their own fashionthey did not go in for towerstheir houses were usually long ,  low ,  and comfortablethe oldest kind were ,  indeed ,  no more than built imitations of smials ,  thatched with dry grass or straw ,  or roofed with turves ,  and having walls somewhat bulgedthat stage ,  however ,  belonged to the early days of the shire ,  and hobbit - building had long since been altered ,  improved by devices ,  learned from dwarves ,  or discovered by themselvesa preference for round windows ,  and even round doors ,  was the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit - architecturethe houses and the holes of shire - hobbits were often large ,  and inhabited by large familiesall hobbits were ,  in any case ,  clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great carethey drew long and elaborate family - trees with innumerable branchesin dealing with hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom ,  and in what degreeit would be impossible in this book to set out a family - tree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these tales tell ofthe genealogical trees at the end of the red book of westmarch are a small book in themselves ,  and all but hobbits would find them exceedingly dullhobbits delighted in such things ,  if they were accurate :  they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew ,  set out fair and square with no contradictionsthere is another astonishing thing about hobbits of old that must be mentioned ,  an astonishing habit :  they imbibed or inhaled ,  through pipes of clay or wood ,  the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb ,  which they called pipe - weed or leaf ,  a variety probably of nicotianaa great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom ,  or  ' art '  as the hobbits preferred to call itall that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together by meriadoc brandybuck  ( later master of buckland )  ,  and since he and the tobacco of the southfarthing play a part in the history that follows ,  his remarks in the introduction to his herblore of the shire may be quotedwhen hobbits first began to smoke is not known ,  all the legends and family histories take it for granted ;  for ages folk in the shire smoked various herbs ,  some fouler ,  some sweeterbut all accounts agree that tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing first grew the true pipe - weed in his gardens in the days of isengrim the second ,  about the year 1070 of shire - reckoningthe best home - grown still comes from that district ,  especially the varieties now known as longbottom leaf ,  old toby ,  and southern starhe knew much about herbs ,  but he was no travellerit is said that in his youth he went often to bree ,  though he certainly never went further from the shire than thatit is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in bree ,  where now ,  at any rate ,  it grows well on the south slopes of the hillthe bree - hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe - weedthey claim ,  of course ,  to have done everything before the people of the shire ,  whom they refer to as  " colonists "  ;  but in this case their claim is ,  i think ,  likely to be trueand certainly it was from bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among dwarves and such other folk ,  rangers ,  wizards ,  or wanderers ,  as still passed to and fro through that ancient road - meetingthe home and centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of bree ,  the prancing pony ,  that has been kept by the family of butterbur from time beyond recordit grows abundantly in gondor ,  and there is richer and larger than in the north ,  where it is never found wild ,  and flourishes only in warm sheltered places like longbottomthe men of gondor call it sweet galenas ,  and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowersfrom that land it must have been carried up the greenway during the long centuries between the coming of elendil and our own daybut even the d˙nedain of gondor allow us this credit :  hobbits first put it into pipesnot even the wizards first thought of that before we didthough one wizard that i knew took up the art long ago ,  and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind tonorth ,  south ,  east ,  and west ;  and these again each into a number of folklands ,  which still bore the names of some of the old leading families ,  although by the time of this history these names were no longer found only in their proper folklandsnearly all tooks still lived in the tookland ,  but that was not true of many other families ,  such as the bagginses or the boffinsoutside the farthings were the east and west marches :  the buckland  ( see beginning of chapter v ,  book i )  ;  and the westmarch added to the shire in sthe shire at this time had hardly any  ' government 'families for the most part managed their own affairsgrowing food and eating it occupied most of their timein other matters they were ,  as a rule ,  generous and not greedy ,  but contented and moderate ,  so that estates ,  farms ,  workshops ,  and small trades tended to remain unchanged for generationsthere remained ,  of course ,  the ancient tradition concerning the high king at fornost ,  or norbury as they called it ,  away north of the shirebut there had been no king for nearly a thousand years ,  and even the ruins of kings '  norbury were covered with grassyet the hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things  ( such as trolls )  that they had not heard of the kingfor they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws ;  and usually they kept the laws of free will ,  because they were the rules  ( as they said )  ,  both ancient and justit is true that the took family had long been pre - eminent ;  for the office of thain had passed to them  ( from the oldbucks )  some centuries before ,  and the chief took had borne that title ever sincethe thain was the master of the shire - moot ,  and captain of the shire - muster and the hobbitry - in - arms ,  but as muster and moot were only held in times of emergency ,  which no longer occurred ,  the thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignitythe took family was still ,  indeed ,  accorded a special respect ,  for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy ,  and was liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperamentthe latter qualities ,  however ,  were now rather tolerated  ( in the rich )  than generally approvedthe custom endured ,  nonetheless ,  of referring to the head of the family as the took ,  and of adding to his name ,  if required ,  a number :  such as isengrim the second ,  for instancethe only real official in the shire at this date was the mayor of michel delving  ( or of the shire )  ,  who was elected every seven years at the free fair on the white downs at the lithe ,  that is at midsummeras mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets ,  given on the shire - holidays ,  which occurred at frequent intervalsbut the offices of postmaster and first shirriff were attached to the mayoralty ,  so that he managed both the messenger service and the watchthese were the only shire - services ,  and the messengers were the most numerous ,  and much the busier of the twoby no means all hobbits were lettered ,  but those who were wrote constantly to all their friends  ( and a selection of their relations )  who lived further off than an afternoon ' s walkthe shirriffs was the name that the hobbits gave to their police ,  or the nearest equivalent that they possessedthey had ,  of course ,  no uniforms  ( such things being quite unknown )  ,  only a feather in their caps ;  and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen ,  more concerned with the strayings of beasts than of peoplethere were in all the shire only twelve of them ,  three in each farthing ,  for inside worka rather larger body ,  varying at need ,  was employed to  ' beat the bounds '  ,  and to see that outsiders of any kind ,  great or small ,  did not make themselves a nuisanceat the time when this story begins the bounders ,  as they were called ,  had been greatly increasedthere were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders ,  or over them :  the first sign that all was not quite as it should be ,  and always had been except in tales and legends of long agofew heeded the sign ,  and not even bilbo yet had any notion of what it portendedsixty years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey ,  and he was old even for hobbits ,  who reached a hundred as often as not ;  but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought backhow much or how little he revealed to no one ,  not even to frodo his favourite  ' nephew 'and he still kept secret the ring that he bad foundas is told in the hobbit ,  there came one day to bilbo ' s door the great wizard ,  gandalf the grey ,  and thirteen dwarves with him :  none other ,  indeed ,  than thorin oakenshield ,  descendant of kings ,  and his twelve companions in exilewith them he set out ,  to his own lasting astonishment ,  on a morning of april ,  it being then the year 1341 shire - reckoning ,  on a quest of great treasure ,  the dwarf - hoards of the kings under the mountain ,  beneath erebor in dale ,  far off in the eastthe quest was successful ,  and the dragon that guarded the hoard was destroyedyet ,  though before all was won the battle of five armies was fought ,  and thorin was slain ,  and many deeds of renown were done ,  the matter would scarcely have concerned later history ,  or earned more than a note in the long annals of the third age ,  but for an  ' accident '  by the waythe party was assailed by orcs in a high pass of the misty mountains as they went towards wilderland ;  and so it happened that bilbo was lost for a while in the black orc - mines deep under the mountains ,  and there ,  as he groped in vain in the dark ,  he put his hand on a ring ,  lying on the floor of a tunnelhe put it in his pocketit seemed then like mere lucktrying to find his way outbilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains ,  until he could go no furtherat the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light ,  and on an island of rock in the water lived gollumhe was a loathsome little creature :  he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet ,  peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish with his long fingers ,  and eating them rawhe ate any living thing ,  even orc ,  if he could catch it and strangle it without a strugglehe possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago ,  when he still lived in the light :  a ring of gold that made its wearer invisibleit was the one thing he loved ,  his  ' precious '  ,  and he talked to it ,  even when it was not with himfor he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island ,  except when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the minesmaybe he would have attacked bilbo at once ,  if the ring had been on him when they met ;  but it was not ,  and the hobbit held in his hand an elvish knife ,  which served him as a swordso to gain time gollum challenged bilbo to the riddle - game ,  saying that if he asked a riddle which bilbo could not guess ,  then he would kill him and eat him ;  but if bilbo defeated him ,  then he would do as bilbo wished :  he would lead him to a way out of the tunnelssince he was lost in the dark without hope ,  and could neither go on nor backbilbo accepted the challenge ;  and they asked one another many riddlesin the end bilbo won the game ,  more by luck  ( as it seemed )  than by wits ;  for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask ,  and cried out ,  as his hand came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten :  what haw i got in my pocketthis gollum failed to answer ,  though he demanded three guessesthe authorities ,  it is true ,  differ whether this last question was a mere  ' question '  and not a  ' riddle '  according to the strict rules of the game ;  but all agree that ,  after accepting it and trying to guess the answer ,  gollum was bound by his promiseand bilbo pressed him to keep his word ;  for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false ,  even though such promises were held sacred ,  and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break thembut after ages alone in the dark gollum ' s heart was black ,  and treachery was in ithe slipped away ,  and returned to the island ,  of which bilbo knew nothing ,  not far off in the dark waterthere ,  he thought ,  lay his ringhe was hungry now ,  and angry ,  and once his  ' precious '  was with him he would not fear any weapon at allbut the ring was not on the island ;  he had lost it ,  it was gonehis screech sent a shiver down bilbo ' s back ,  though he did not yet understand what had happenedbut gollum had at last leaped to a guess ,  too latewhat has it got in its pocketsesthe light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his  ' precious 'just in time bilbo saw his peril ,  and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water ;  and once more he was saved by his luckfor just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket ,  and the ring slipped quietly on to his fingerso it was that gollum passed him without seeing him ,  and went to guard the way out ,  lest the  ' thief '  should escapewarily bilbo followed him ,  as he went along ,  cursing ,  and talking to himself about his  ' precious '  ;  from which talk at last even bilbo guessed the truth ,  and hope came to him in the darkness :  he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from gollumat length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines ,  on the eastward side of the mountainsthere gollum crouched at bay ,  smelling and listening ;  and bilbo was tempted to slay him with his swordbut pity stayed him ,  and though he kept the ring ,  in which his only hope lay ,  he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantagein the end ,  gathering his courage ,  he leaped over gollum in the dark ,  and fled away down the passage ,  pursued by his enemy ' s cries of hate and despair :  thief ,  thiefwe hates it for evernow it is a curious fact that this is not the story as bilbo first told it to his companionsto them his account was that gollum had promised to give him a present ,  if he won the game ;  but when gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone :  a magic ring ,  which had been given to him long ago on his birthdaybilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found ,  and as he had won the game ,  it was already his by rightbut being in a tight place ,  he said nothing about it ,  and made gollum show him the way out ,  as a reward instead of a presentthis account bilbo set down in his memoirs ,  and he seems never to have altered it himself ,  not even after the council of elrondevidently it still appeared in the original red book ,  as it did in several of the copies and abstractsbut many copies contain the true account  ( as an alternative )  ,  derived no doubt from notes by frodo or samwise ,  both of whom learned the truth ,  though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himselfgandalf ,  however ,  disbelieved bilbo ' s first story ,  as soon as he heard it ,  and he continued to be very curious about the ringeventually he got the true tale out of bilbo after much questioning ,  which for a while strained their friendship ;  but the wizard seemed to think the truth importantthough he did not say so to bilbo ,  he also thought it important ,  and disturbing ,  to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first :  quite contrary to his habitthe idea of a  ' present '  was not mere hobbitlike invention ,  all the sameit was suggested to bilbo ,  as he confessed ,  by gollum ' s talk that he overheard ;  for gollum did ,  in fact ,  call the ring his  ' birthday present '  ,  many timesthat also gandalf thought strange and suspicious ;  but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years ,  as will be seen in this bookof bilbo ' s later adventures little more need be said herewith the help of the ring he escaped from the orc - guards at the gate and rejoined his companionshe used the ring many times on his quest ,  chiefly for the help of his friends ;  but he kept it secret from them as long as he couldafter his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone ,  save gandalf and frodo ;  and no one else in the shire knew of its existence ,  or so he believedonly to frodo did he show the account of his journey that he was writinghis sword ,  sting ,  bilbo hung over his fireplace ,  and his coat of marvellous mail ,  the gift of the dwarves from the dragon - hoard ,  he lent to a museum ,  to the michel delving mathom - house in factbut he kept in a drawer at bag end the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels ;  and the ring ,  secured by a fine chain ,  remained in his pockethe returned to his home at bag end on june the 22nd in his fifty - second year  ( sbaggins began the preparations for the celebration of his hundred - and - eleventh birthday  ( sat this point this history beginsat the end of the third age the part played by the hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the shire in the reunited kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history ;  and many of their traditions ,  up to that time still mainly oral ,  were collected and written downthe greater families were also concerned with events in the kingdom at large ,  and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legendsby the end of the first century of the fourth age there were already to be found in the shire several libraries that contained many historical books and recordsthe largest of these collections were probably at undertowers ,  at great smials ,  and at brandy hallthis account of the end of the third age is drawn mainly from the red book of westmarchthat most important source for the history of the war of the ring was so called because it was long preserved at undertowers ,  the home of the fairbairns ,  wardens of the westmarchit was in origin bilbo ' s private diary ,  which he took with him to rivendellfrodo brought it back to the shire ,  together with many loose leaves of notes ,  and during sbut annexed to it and preserved with it ,  probably m a single red case ,  were the three large volumes ,  bound in red leather ,  that bilbo gave to him as a parting giftto these four volumes there was added in westmarch a fifth containing commentaries ,  genealogies ,  and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the fellowshipthe original red book has not been preserved ,  but many copies were made ,  especially of the first volume ,  for the use of the descendants of the children of master samwisethe most important copy ,  however ,  has a different historyit was kept at great smials ,  but it was written in condor ,  probably at the request of the great - grandson of peregrin ,  and completed in sits southern scribe appended this note :  findegil ,  king ' s writer ,  finished this work in iv 172it is an exact copy in all details of the thain ' s book m minas tiriththat book was a copy ,  made at the request of king elessar ,  of the red book of the periannath ,  and was brought to him by the thain peregrin when he retired to gondor in iv 64the thain ' s book was thus the first copy made of the red book and contained much that was later omitted or lostin minas tirith it received much annotation ,  and many corrections ,  especially of names ,  words ,  and quotations in the elvish languages ;  and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of the tale of aragorn and arwen which lie outside the account of the warthe full tale is stated to have been written by barahir ,  grandson of the steward faramir ,  some time after the passing of the kingbut the chief importance of findegil ' s copy is that it alone contains the whole of bilbo ' s  ' translations from the elvish 'these three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which ,  between 1403 and 1418 ,  he had used all the sources available to him in rivendell ,  both living and writtenbut since they were little used by frodo ,  being almost entirely concerned with the elder days ,  no more is said of them heresince meriadoc and peregrin became the heads of their great families ,  and at the same time kept up their connexions with rohan and gondor ,  the libraries at bucklebury and tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the red bookin brandy hall there were many works dealing with eriador and the history of rohansome of these were composed or begun by meriadoc himself ,  though in the shire he was chiefly remembered for his herblore of the shire ,  and for his reckoning of years m which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the shire and bree to those of rivendell ,  gondor ,  and rohanhe also wrote a short treatise on old words and names in the shire ,  having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the rohirrim of such  ' shire - words '  as mathom and old elements in place namesat great smials the books were of less interest to shire - folk ,  though more important for larger historynone of them was written by peregrin ,  but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of gondor :  mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to elendil and his heirsonly here in the shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of n˙menor and the arising of sauronit was probably at great smials that the tale of years was put together ,  with the assistance of material collected by meriadocthough the dates given are often conjectural ,  especially for the second age ,  they deserve attentionit is probable that meriadoc obtained assistance and information from rivendell ,  which he visited more than oncethere ,  though elrond had departed ,  his sons long remained ,  together with some of the high - elven folkit is said that celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of galadriel ;  but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the grey havens ,  and with him went the last living memory of the elder days in middle - earthbilbo baggins of bag end announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy - first birthday with a party of special magnificence ,  there was much talk and excitement in hobbitonbilbo was very rich and very peculiar ,  and had been the wonder of the shire for sixty years ,  ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected returnthe riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend ,  and it was popularly believed ,  whatever the old folk might say ,  that the hill at bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasureand if that was not enough for fame ,  there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel attime wore on ,  but it seemed to have little effect on mrat ninety he was much the same as at fiftyat ninety - nine they began to call him well - preserved ,  but unchanged would have been nearer the markthere were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing ;  it seemed unfair that anyone should possess  ( apparently )  perpetual youth as well as  ( reputedly )  inexhaustible wealthbaggins was generous with his money ,  most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortunehe remained on visiting terms with his relatives  ( except ,  of course ,  the sackville - bagginses )  ,  and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant familiesbut he had no close friends ,  until some of his younger cousins began to grow upthe eldest of these ,  and bilbo ' s favourite ,  was young frodo bagginswhen bilbo was ninety - nine ,  he adopted frodo as his heir ,  and brought him to live at bag end ;  and the hopes of the sackville - bagginses were finally dashedbilbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday ,  september 22ndtwelve more years passedeach year the bagginses had given very lively combined birthday - parties at bag end ;  but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumnbilbo was going to be eleventy - one ,  111 ,  a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit  ( the old took himself had only reached 130 )  ;  and frodo was going to be thirty - three ,  33 )  an important number :  the date of his  ' coming of age 'tongues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater ;  and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the shirethe history and character of mrbilbo baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation ;  and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demandno one had a more attentive audience than old ham gamgee ,  commonly known as the gafferhe held forth at the ivy bush ,  a small inn on the bywater road ;  and he spoke with some authority ,  for he had tended the garden at bag end for forty years ,  and had helped old holman in the same job before thatnow that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints ,  the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son ,  sam gamgeeboth father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodothey lived on the hill itself ,  in number 3 bagshot row just below bag endbilbo ,  as i ' ve always said ,  '  the gaffer declaredwith perfect truth :  for bilbo was very polite to him ,  calling him  ' master hamfast '  ,  and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables ñ in the matter of  ' roots '  ,  especially potatoes ,  the gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood  ( including himself )it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in buckland ,  where folks are so queerthat ' s a dark bad place ,  if half the tales be truethey fool about with boats on that big river ñ and that isn ' t naturalsmall wonder that trouble came of it ,  i saybut be that as it may ,  mrfrodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meetvery much like mrbilbo ,  and in more than looksafter all his father was a bagginsa decent respectable hobbit was mrdrogo baggins ;  there was never much to tell of him ,  till he was drowndedthey had heard this and other darker rumours before ,  of course ;  but hobbits have a passion for family history ,  and they were ready to hear it againdrogo ,  he married poor miss primula brandybuckshe was our mrbilbo ' s first cousin on the mother ' s side  ( her mother being the youngest of the old took ' s daughters )  ;  and mrdrogo was his second cousinfrodo is his first and second cousin ,  once removed either way ,  as the saying is ,  if you follow medrogo was staying at brandy hall with his father - in - law ,  old master gorbadoc ,  as he often did after his marriage  ( him being partial to his vittles ,  and old gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table )  ;  and he went out boatingon the brandywine river ;  and he and his wife were drownded ,  and poor mrfrodo only a child and allboats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of troubleanyway :  there was this mrfrodo left an orphan and stranded ,  as you might say ,  among those queer bucklanders ,  being brought up anyhow in brandy halla regular warren ,  by all accountsold master gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the placebilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folkthey thought they were going to get bag end ,  that time when he went off and was thought to be deadand then he comes back and orders them off ;  and he goes on living and living ,  and never looking a day older ,  bless himand suddenly he produces an heir ,  and has all the papers made out properthe sackville - bagginses won ' t never see the inside of bag end now ,  or it is to

the sale was onand in the middle of it all mrbilbo comes up the hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chestsi don ' t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts ,  where there be mountains of gold ,  they say ;  but there wasn ' t enough to fill tunnelsbut my lad sam will know more about thathe ' s in and out of bag endcrazy about stories of the old days he is ,  and he listens to all mrbilbo ' s talesbilbo has learned him his letters ñ meaning no harm ,  mark you ,  and i hope no harm will come of itdon ' t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters ,  or you ' ll land in trouble too big for you ,  ' i says to himand i might say it to others ,  '  he added with a look at the stranger and the millerbut the gaffer did not convince his audiencethe legend of bilbo ' s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbitsand look at the outlandish folk that visit him :  dwarves coming at night ,  and that old wandering conjuror ,  gandalf ,  and allyou can say what you like ,  gaffer ,  but bag end ' s a queer place ,  and its folk are queerersandyman ,  '  retorted the gaffer ,  disliking the miller even more than usualif that ' s being queer ,  then we could do with a bit more queerness in these partsthere ' s some not far away that wouldn ' t offer a pint of beer to a friend ,  if they lived in a hole with golden wallsbut they do things proper at bag endour sam says that everyone ' s going to be invited to the party ,  and there ' s going to be presents ,  mark you ,  presents for all ñ this very month as isa day or two later a rumour  ( probably started by the knowledgeable sam )  was spread about that there were going to be fireworks ñ fireworks ,  what is more ,  such as had not been seen in the shire for nigh on a century ,  not indeed since the old took dieddays passed and the day drew neareran odd - looking waggon laden with odd - looking packages rolled into

beards and deep hoodsa few of them remained at bag endat the end of the second week in september a cart came in through bywater from the direction of the brandywine bridge in broad daylightan old man

children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hillit had a cargo of fireworks ,  as they rightly guessedat bilbo ' s front door the old man began to unload :  there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes ,  each labelled with a large red g  and the elf - rune ,that was gandalf ' s mark ,  of course ,  and the old man was gandalf the wizard ,  whose fame in the shire was due mainly to his skill with fires ,  smokes ,  and lightshis real business was far more difficult and dangerous ,  but the shire - folk knew nothing about itto them he was just one of the  ' attractions '  at the partyhence the excitement of the hobbit - childrenthey knew him by sight ,  though he only appeared in hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long ;  but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays ñ they now belonged to the legendary pastwhen the old man ,  helped by bilbo and some dwarves ,  had finished unloadingbilbo gave a few pennies away ;  but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming ,  to the disappointment of the onlookersthe young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while ,  and then made off ,  feeling that the day of the party would never comeinside bag end ,  bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the gardenthe late afternoon was bright and

cartsthere might have been some grumbling about  ' dealing locally '  ,  but that very week orders began to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision ,  commodity ,  or luxury that could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhoodpeople became enthusiastic ;  and they began to tick off the days on the calendar ;  and they watched eagerly for the postman ,  hoping for invitationsbefore long the invitations began pouring out ,  and the hobbiton post - office was blocked ,  and the bywater post - office was snowed under ,  and voluntary assistant postmen were called forthere was a constant stream of them going up the hill ,  carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you ,  i shall certainly comea notice appeared on the gate at bag end :  no admittance except on party businesseven those who had ,  or pretended to have party business were seldom allowed insidebilbo was busy :  writing invitations ,  ticking off answers ,  packing up presents ,  and making some private preparations of his ownfrom the time of gandalf ' s arrival he remained hidden from viewone morning the hobbits woke to find the large field ,  south of bilbo ' s front door ,  covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilionsa special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road ,  and wide steps and a large white gate were built therethe three hobbit - families of bagshot row ,  adjoining the field ,  were intensely interested and generally enviedold gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his gardenthe tents began to go upthere was a specially large pavilion ,  so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it ,  and stood proudly near one end ,  at the head of the chief tablelanterns were hung on all its branchesmore promising still  ( to the hobbits '  mind )  :  an enormous open - air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the fielda draught of cooks ,  from every inn and eating - house for miles around ,  arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at bag endexcitement rose to its heightthen the weather clouded overthat was on wednesday the eve of the partyanxiety was intensethen thursday ,  september the 22nd ,  actually dawnedthe sun got up ,  the clouds vanished ,  flags were unfurled and the fun beganbilbo baggins called it a party ,  but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into onepractically everybody living near was inviteda very few were overlooked by accident ,  but as they turned up all the same ,  that did not mattermany people from other parts of the shire were also asked ;  and there were even a few from outside the bordersbilbo met the guests  ( and additions )  at the new white gate in personhe gave away presents to all and sundry ñ the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gatehobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdaysnot very expensive ones ,  as a rule ,  and not so lavishly as on this occasion ;  but it was not a bad systemactually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year it was somebody ' s birthday ,  so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a weekbut they never got tired of themon this occasion the presents were unusually goodthe hobbit - children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eatingthere were toys the like of which they had never seen before ,  all beautiful and some obviously magicalmany of them had indeed been ordered a year before ,  and had come all the way from the mountain and from dale ,  and were of real dwarf - makewhen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate ,  there were songs ,  dances ,  music ,  games ,  and ,  of course ,  food and drinkthere were three official meals :  lunch ,  tea ,  and dinner  ( or supper )but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating togetherat other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking ñ continuously from elevenses until six - thirty ,  when the fireworks startedthe fireworks were by gandalf :  they were not only brought by him ,  but designed and made by him ;  and the special effects ,  set pieces ,  and flights of rockets were let off by himbut there was also a generous distribution of squibs ,  crackers ,  backarappers ,  sparklers ,  torches ,  dwarf - candles ,  elf - fountains ,  goblin - barkers and thunder - clapsthey were all superbthe art of gandalf improved with agethere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voicesthere were green trees with trunks of dark smoke :  their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment ,  and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits ,  disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned facesthere were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees ;  there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles ,  or sailing ships ,  or a phalanx of flying swans ;  there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain ;  there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army ,  and came down again into the water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakesand there was also one last surprise ,  in honour of bilbo ,  and it startled the hobbits exceedingly ,  as gandalf intendedthe lights went outa great smoke went upit shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance ,  and began to glow at the summitit spouted green and scarlet flamesout flew a red - golden dragon ñ not life - size ,  but terribly life - like :  fire came from his jaws ,  his eyes glared down ;  there was a roar ,  and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowdthey all ducked ,  and many fell flat on their facesthe dragon passed like an express train ,  turned a somersault ,  and burst over bywater with a deafening explosionthe pain and alarm vanished at once ,  and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feetthere was a splendid supper for everyone ;  for everyone ,  that is ,  except those invited to the special family dinner - partythis was held in the great pavilion with the treethe invitations were limited to twelve dozen  ( a number also called by the hobbits one gross ,  though the word was not considered proper to use of people )  ;  and the guests were selected from all the families to which bilbo and frodo were related ,  with the addition of a few special unrelated friends  ( such as gandalf )many young hobbits were included ,  and present by parental permission ;  for hobbits were easy - going with their children in the matter of sitting up late ,  especially when there was a chance of getting them a free mealbringing up young hobbits took a lot of provenderthere were many bagginses and boffins ,  and also many tooks and brandybucks ;  there were various grubbs  ( relations of bilbo baggins '  grandmother )  ,  and various chubbs  ( connexions of his took grandfather )  ;  and a selection of burrowses ,  bolgers ,  bracegirdles ,  brockhouses ,  goodbodies ,  hornblowers and proudfootssome of these were only very distantly connected with bilbo ,  and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton before ,  as they lived in remote corners of the shirethe sackville - bagginses were not forgottenotho and his wife lobelia were presentthey disliked bilbo and detested frodo ,  but so magnificent was the invitation card ,  written in golden ink ,  that they had felt it was impossible to refusebesides ,  their cousin ,  bilbo ,  had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputationall the one hundred and forty - four guests expected a pleasant feast ;  though they rather dreaded the after - dinner speech of their host  ( an inevitable item )he was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry ;  and sometimes ,  after a glass or two ,  would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journeythe guests were not disappointed :  they had a very pleasant feast ,  in fact an engrossing entertainment :  rich ,  abundant ,  varied ,  and prolongedthe purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks ;  but as bilbo ' s catering had depleted the stocks of most stores ,  cellars and warehouses for miles around ,  that did not matter muchafter the feast  ( more or less )  came the speechmost of the company were ,  however ,  now in a tolerant mood ,  at that delightful stage which they called  ' filling up the corners 'they were sipping their favourite drinks ,  and nibbling at their favourite dainties ,  and their fears were forgottenthey were prepared to listen to anything ,  and to cheer at every full stopmy dear people ,  began bilbo ,  rising in his placebilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated treethe light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face ;  the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoatthey could all see him standing ,  waving one hand in the air ,  the other was in his trouser - pocketmy dear bagginses and boffins ,  he began again ;  and my dear tooks and brandybucks ,  and grubbs ,  and chubbs ,  and burrowses ,  and hornblowers ,  and bolgers ,  bracegirdles ,  goodbodies ,  brockhouses and proudfootshis name ,  of course ,  was proudfoot ,  and well merited ;  his feet were large ,  exceptionally furry ,  and both were on the tableproudfoots ,  repeated bilboalso my good sackville - bagginses that i welcome back at last to bag endtoday is my one hundred and eleventh birthday :  i am eleventy - one

)noises of trumpets and horns ,  pipes and flutes ,  and other musical instrumentsthere were ,  as has been said ,  many young hobbits presenthundreds of musical crackers had been pulledmost of them bore the mark dale on them ;  which did not convey much to most of the hobbits ,  but they all agreed they were marvellous crackersthey contained instruments ,  small ,  but of perfect make and enchanting tonesindeed ,  in one corner some of the young tooks and brandybucks ,  supposing uncle bilbo to have finished  ( since he had plainly said all that was necessary )  ,  now got up an impromptu orchestra ,  and began a merry dance - tunemaster everard took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the springle - ring :  a pretty dance ,  but rather vigorousbut bilbo had not finishedseizing a horn from a youngster near by ,  he blew three loud hootsthe noise subsidedi shall not keep you long ,  he criedcheers from all the assemblyi have called you all together for a purposesomething in the way that he said this made an impressionthere was almost silence ,  and one or two of the tooks pricked up their earsindeed ,  for three purposesfirst of all ,  to tell you that i am immensely fond of you all ,  and that eleventy - one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbitstremendous outburst of approvali don ' t know half of you half as well as i should like ;  and i like less than half of you half as well as you deservethis was unexpected and rather difficultthere was some scattered clapping ,  but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a complimentsecondly ,  to celebrate my birthdaycheers againi should say :  our birthdayfor it is ,  of course ,  also the birthday of my heir and nephew ,  frodohe comes of age and into his inheritance todaysome perfunctory clapping by the elders ;  and some loud shouts of  ' frodojolly old frodo ,  '  from the juniorsthe sackville - bagginses scowled ,  and wondered what was meant by  ' coming into his inheritance 'together we score one hundred and forty - fouryour numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total :  one gross ,  if i may use the expressionthis was ridiculousmany of his guests ,  and especially the sackville - bagginses ,  were insulted ,  feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number ,  like goods in a packagevulgar expressioni was only fifty - one then ,  and birthdays did not seem so importantthe banquet was very splendid ,  however ,  though i had a bad cold at the time ,  i remember ,  and could only say  ' thag you very buch 'i now repeat it more correctly :  thank you very much for coming to my little partyobstinate silencethey all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent ;  and they were getting boredwhy couldn ' t he stop talking and let them drink his healthbut bilbo did not sing or recitehe paused for a momentthirdly and finally ,  he said ,  i wish to make an announcementhe spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still couldi regret to announce that ñ though ,  as i said ,  eleventy - one years is far too short a time to spend among you ñ this is the endi am leaving nowhe stepped down and vanishedthere was a blinding flash of light ,  and the guests all blinkedwhen they opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seenone hundred and forty - four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechlessold odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stampedthen there was a dead silence ,  until suddenly ,  after several deep breaths ,  every baggins ,  boffin ,  took ,  brandybuck ,  grubb ,  chubb ,  burrows ,  bolger ,  bracegirdle ,  brockhouse ,  goodbody ,  hornblower ,  and proudfoot began to talk at onceit was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste ,  and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyancei always said so ,  '  was probably the most popular commenteven the tooks  ( with a few exceptions )  thought bilbo ' s behaviour was absurdfor the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prankbut old rory brandybuck was not so sureneither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits ,  and he said to his daughter - in - law ,  esmeralda :   ' there ' s something fishy in this ,  my deari believe that mad baggins is off againsilly old foolbut why worryhe hasn ' t taken the vittles with himfrodo was the only one present who had said nothingfor some time he had sat silent beside bilbo ' s empty chair ,  and ignored all remarks and questionshe had enjoyed the joke ,  of course ,  even though he had been in the knowhe had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guestsbut at the same time he felt deeply troubled :  he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearlymost of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing bilbo baggins '  oddities ,  past and present ;  but the sackville - bagginses had already departed in wrathfrodo did not want to have any more to do with the partyhe gave orders for more wine to be served ;  then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of bilbo ,  and slipped out of the pavilionas for bilbo baggins ,  even while he was making his speech ,  he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket :  his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many yearsas he stepped down he slipped it on his finger ,  and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton againhe walked briskly back to his hole ,  and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the fieldthen he went inhe took off his party clothes ,  folded up and wrapped in tissue - paper his embroidered silk waistcoat ,  and put it awaythen he put on quickly some old untidy garments ,  and fastened round his waist a worn leather belton it he hung a short sword in a battered black - leather scabbardfrom a locked drawer ,  smelling of moth - balls ,  he took out an old cloak and hoodthey had been locked up as if they were very precious ,  but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed :  it might have been dark greenthey were rather too large for himhe then went into his study ,  and from a large strong - box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths ,  and a leather - bound manuscript ;  and also a large bulky envelopethe book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there ,  already nearly fullinto the envelope he slipped his golden ring ,  and its fine chain ,  and then sealed it ,  and addressed it to frodoat first he put it on the mantelpiece ,  but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocketat that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly ini suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plana little addition of your own ,  i supposeyou have wisely kept that ring secret all these years ,  and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain

the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its placea spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit ' s face againsuddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laughbilbo chose his favourite

airwhat fun to be off again ,  off on the road with dwarvesthis is what i have really been longing for ,  for yearstake care of yourselfyou are old enough ,  and perhaps wise enoughi don ' t caredon '

to himself ,  he sang softly in the dark :           the road goes ever on and on            down from the door where it begannow far ahead the road has gone ,             and i must follow ,  if i can ,            pursuing it with eager feet ,             until it joins some larger way           where many paths and errands meetand whither theni cannot sayhe paused ,  silent for a momentthen without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents ,  and followed by his three companions went round into his garden ,  and trotted down the long sloping pathhe jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom ,  and took to the meadows ,  passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grassgandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darknessfrodo came in soon afterwards ,  and found him sitting in the dark ,  deep in thoughthe always used to joke about serious thingsi wish i had come back sooner ,  just to see him offhe ' ll be all right ñ nowhe left a packet for youthere it isand also ,  i fancy ,  you ' ll find a golden ringi wonder whystill ,  it may be usefulbut keep it secret ,  and keep it safenow i am going to bedrumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field ,  but frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morningabout midnight carriages came for the important folkone by one they rolled away ,  filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbitsgardeners came by arrangement ,  and removed in wheel - barrows those that had inadvertently remained behindnight slowly passedthe sun rosethe hobbits rose rather latermorning went onpeople came and began  ( by orders )  to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs ,  and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates ,  and the lanterns ,  and the flowering shrubs in boxes ,  and the crumbs and cracker - paper ,  the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs ,  and the uneaten food  ( a very small item )then a number of other people came  ( without orders )  :  bagginses ,  and boffins ,  and bolgers ,  and tooks ,  and other guests that lived or were staying nearby mid - day ,  when even the best - fed were out and about again ,  there was a large crowd at bag end ,  uninvited but not unexpectedfrodo was waiting on the step ,  smiling ,  but looking rather tired and worriedhe welcomed all the callers ,  but he had not much more to say than beforehis reply to all inquiries was simply this :   ' mrbilbo baggins has gone away ;  as far as i know ,  for goodinside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furnitureon every item there was a label tiedthere were several labels of this sort :      for adelard took ,  for his very own ,  from bilbo ,  on an umbrellaadelard had carried off many unlabelled onesfor dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence ,  with love from bilbo ,  on a large waste - paper basketdora was drogo '

useful ,  from bmilo never answered lettersfor angelica ' s use ,  from uncle bilbo ,  on a round convex mirrorshe was a young baggins ,  and too obviously considered her face shapelyfor the

present ,  on a case of silver spoonsbilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons ,  while he was away on his former journeylobelia knew that quite wellwhen she arrived later in the day ,  she took the point at once ,  but she also took the spoonsthis is only a small selection of the assembled presentsbilbo ' s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long lifeit was a tendency of hobbit - holes to get cluttered up :  for which the custom of giving so many birthday - presents was largely responsiblenot ,  of course ,  that the birthday - presents were always new ,  there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district ;  but bilbo had usually given new presents ,  and kept those that he receivedthe old hole was now being cleared a littleevery one of the various parting gifts had labels ,  written out personally by bilbo ,  and several had some point ,  or some jokebut ,  of course ,  most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcomethe poorer hobbits ,  and especially those of bagshot row ,  did very wellold gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes ,  a new spade ,  a woollen waistcoat ,  and a bottle of ointment for creaking jointsold rory brandybuck ,  in return for much hospitality ,  got a dozen bottles of old winyards :  a strong red wine from the southfarthing ,  and now quite mature ,  as it had been laid down by bilbo ' s fatherrory quite forgave bilbo ,  and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottlethere was plenty of everything left for frodoand ,  of course ,  all the chief treasures ,  as well as the books ,  pictures ,  and more than enough furniture ,  were left in his possessionthere was ,  however ,  no sign nor mention of money or jewellery :  not a penny - piece or a glass bead was given awayfrodo had a very trying time that afternoona false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire ;  and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there ,  but could not be kept outlabels got torn off and mixed ,  and quarrels broke outsome people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall ;  and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them ,  or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatchedthe road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcartsin the middle of the commotion the sackville - bagginses arrivedfrodo had retired for a while and left his friend merry brandybuck to keep an eye on thingswhen otho loudly demanded to see frodo ,  merry bowed politelyjust go and tell him soit did not improve their temperseventually they were shown into the studyfrodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of himhe looked indisposed ñ to see sackville - bagginses at any rate ;  and he stood up ,  fidgeting with something in his pocketbut he spoke quite politelythe sackville - bagginses were rather offensivethey began by offering him bad bargain - prices  ( as between friends )  for various valuable and unlabelled thingswhen frodo replied that only the things specially directed by bilbo were being given away ,  they said the whole affair was very fishyi insist on seeing the willhe read the will carefully and snortedit was ,  unfortunately ,  very clear and correct  ( according to the legal customs of hobbits ,  which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink )fiddlesticksbut lobelia was not so easily got rid ofa little later frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place ,  investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floorshe escorted her firmly off the premises ,  after he had relieved her of several small  ( but rather valuable )  articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrellaher face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark ;  but all she found to say ,  turning round on the step ,  was :       ' you ' ll live to regret it ,  young fellowwhy didn ' t you go tooyou don ' t belong here ;  you ' re no baggins ñ you ñ you ' re a brandybuckthat was an insult ,  if you like ,  '  said frodo as he shut the door on herfrodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot  ( old odo proudfoot ' s grandson )  ,  who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry ,  where he thought there was an echothe legend of bilbo ' s gold excited both curiosity and hope ;  for legendary gold  ( mysteriously obtained ,  if not positively ill - gotten )  ,  is ,  as every one knows ,  any one ' s for the finding ñ unless the search is interruptedwhen he had overcome sancho and pushed him out ,  frodo collapsed on a chair in the hallit ' s time to close the shop ,  merry ,  '  he saidhe had hardly sat down ,  when there came a soft knock at the front - doorit can waitthe knock was repeated ,  much louder ,  but he took no noticesuddenly the wizard ' s head appeared at the windowhalf a minutei thought it was lobeliabut i saw her some time ago ,  driving a pony - trap towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milkhonestly ,  i nearly tried on bilbo ' s ringi longed to disappearin fact ,  it is partly about that that i have come to say a last wordi have heard his story :  how he found it ,  and how he used it :  on his journey ,  i meanhe said you had pestered him till he told you ,  so i had better know tooit ' s mine anywayit was very unlike bilbo to do so ,  anyway ;  and i thought it rather oddbut odd things may happen to people that have such treasures ñ if they use themlet it be a warning to you to be very careful with itit may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish tono need to worrybut if you take my advice you will use it very seldom ,  or not at allat least i beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicioni say again :  keep it safe ,  and keep it secretwhat are you afraid ofi may be able to tell you something when i come backi am going off at once :  so this is good - bye for the presenti was looking forward to your helpi may be away for a good while ;  but i ' ll come and see you again ,  as soon as i canexpect me when you see mei shall slip in quietlyi shan ' t often be visiting the shire openly againi find that i have become rather unpopularthey say i am a nuisance and a disturber of the peacesome people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away ,  or worseif you want to know ,  there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealthhow abominablei would give them bag end and everything else ,  if i could get bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with himi love the shirebut i begin to wish ,  somehow ,  that i had gone tooi wonder if i shall ever see him againgood - bye nowtake care of yourselflook out for me ,  especially at unlikely timeshe gave a final wave of his hand ,  and walked off at a surprising pace ;  but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent ,  almost as if he was carrying a great weightthe evening was closing in ,  and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilightfrodo did not see him again for a long timechapter 2            the shadow of the past     the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety - nine daysthe second disappearance of mrbilbo baggins was discussed in hobbiton ,  and indeed all over the shire ,  for a year and a day ,  and was remembered much longer than thatit became a fireside - story for young hobbits ;  and eventually mad baggins ,  who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold ,  became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgottenbut in the meantime ,  the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that bilbo ,  who had always been rather cracked ,  had at last gone quite mad ,  and had run off into the bluethere he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic ,  but hardly an untimely ,  endthe blame was mostly laid on gandalfand to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone ,  and he did settle down ,  but the growth of hobbit - sense was not very noticeableindeed ,  he at once began to carry on bilbo ' s reputation for oddityhe refused to go into mourning ;  and the next year he gave a party in honour of bilbo ' s hundred - and - twelfth birthday ,  which he called hundred - weight feastbut that was short of the mark ,  for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink ,  as hobbits saysome people were rather shocked ;  but frodo kept up the custom of giving bilbo ' s birthday party year after year until they got used to ithe said that he did not think bilbo was deadwhen they asked :   ' where is he thenhe lived alone ,  as bilbo had done ;  but he had a good many friends ,  especially among the younger hobbits  ( mostly descendants of the old took )  who had as children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag endfolco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these ;  but his closest friends were peregrin took  ( usually called pippin )  ,  and merry brandybuck  ( his real name was meriadoc ,  but that was seldom remembered )frodo went tramping all over the shire with them ;  but more often he wandered by himself ,  and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlightmerry and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at times ,  as bilbo had doneas time went on ,  people began to notice that frodo also showed signs of good  ' preservation '  :  outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweensfrodo himself ,  after the first shock ,  found that being his own master and the mrbaggins of bag end was rather pleasantfor some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the futurebut half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with bilbo was steadily growinghe found himself wondering at times ,  especially in the autumn ,  about the wild lands ,  and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreamshe began to say to himself :   ' perhaps i shall cross the river myself one dayfrodo began to feel restless ,  and the old paths seemed too well - troddenhe looked at maps ,  and wondered what lay beyond their edges :  maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its bordershe took to wandering further afield and more often by himself ;  and merry and his other friends watched him anxiouslyoften he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the shirethere were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside ;  and as gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years ,  frodo gathered all the news he couldelves ,  who seldom walked in the shire ,  could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening ,  passing and not returning ;  but they were leaving middle - earth and were no longer concerned with its troublesthere were ,  however ,  dwarves on the road in unusual numbersthe ancient east - west road ran through the shire to its end at the grey havens ,  and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the blue mountainsthey were the hobbits '  chief source of news from distant parts ñ if they wanted any :  as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no morebut now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries ,  seeking refuge in the westthey were troubled ,  and some spoke in whispers of the enemy and of the land of mordorthat name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past ,  like a shadow in the background of their memories ;  but it was ominous and disquietingit seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of mordorthe dark tower had been rebuilt ,  it was saidfrom there the power was spreading far and wide ,  and away far east and south there were wars and growing fearorcs were multiplying again in the mountainstrolls were abroad ,  no longer dull - witted ,  but cunning and armed with dreadful weaponsand there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these ,  but they had no namelittle of all this ,  of course ,  reached the ears of ordinary hobbitsbut even the deafest and most stay - at - home began to hear queer tales ;  and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange thingsthe conversation in the green dragon at bywater ,  one evening in the spring of frodo ' s fiftieth year ,  showed that even in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had been heard ,  though most hobbits still laughed at themsam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire ,  and opposite him was ted sandyman ,  the miller ' s son ;  and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talkbut i can hear fireside - tales and children ' s stories at home ,  if i want towho invented the stories anywaytake dragons nowi heard tell of them when i was a youngster ,  but there ' s no call to believe in them nowthere ' s only one dragon in bywater ,  and that ' s green ,  '  he said ,  getting a general laughthey do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long backhe works for mrboffin at overhill and goes up to the northfarthing for the huntingyour hal ' s always saying he ' s seen things ;  and maybe he sees things that ain ' t therewhat he saw was an elm tree ,  as like as notthere was some laughing and clapping :  the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a pointthe bounders have never been so busy beforethey do say they are going to the harbours ,  out away beyond the white towersbut it was an old tradition that away over there stood the grey havens ,  from which at times elven - ships set sail ,  never to returnbut ted laughedand i don ' t see what it matters to me or youlet them sailbut i warrant you haven ' t seen them doing it ;  nor any one else in the shirehe believed he had once seen an elf in the woods ,  and still hoped to see more one dayof all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half - remembered stories about the elves as the hobbits knew ,  had always moved him most deeplybaggins now ,  that i work forhe told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elvesbilbo knew more :  many ' s the talk i had with him when i was a little ladif that ' s where you get your news from ,  you ' ll never want for moonshinewell ,  friends ,  i ' m off homeyour good healthsam sat silent and said no morehe had a good deal to think aboutfor one thing ,  there was a lot to do up in the bag end garden ,  and he would have a busy day tomorrow ,  if the weather clearedthe grass was growing fastbut sam had more on his mind than gardeningafter a while he sighed ,  and got up and went outit was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rainthe sun was down ,  and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into nighthe walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and up the hill ,  whistling softly and thoughtfullyit was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absencefor three years after the party he had been awaythen he paid frodo a brief visit ,  and after taking a good look at him he went off againduring the next year or two he had turned up fairly often ,  coming unexpectedly after dusk ,  and going off without warning before sunrisehe would not discuss his own business and journeys ,  and seemed chiefly interested in small news about frodo ' s health and doingsthen suddenly his visits had ceasedit was over nine years since frodo had seen or heard of him ,  and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbitsbut that evening ,  as sam was walking home and twilight was fading ,  there came the once familiar tap on the study windowfrodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delightthey looked hard at one anotherhe pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world ,  and soon they were deep in talk ,  and they stayed up far into the nightnext morning after a late breakfast ,  the wizard was sitting with frodo by the open window of the studya bright fire was on the hearth ,  but the sun was warm ,  and the wind was in the southeverything looked fresh ,  and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees '  fingersgandalf was thinking of a spring ,  nearly eighty years before ,  when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchiefhis hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then ,  and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer ,  and his face more lined with care and wisdom ;  but his eyes were as bright as ever ,  and he smoked and blew smoke - rings with the same vigour and delighthe was smoking now in silence ,  for frodo was sitting still ,  deep in thoughteven in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that gandalf had broughtat last he broke the silencedon ' t you think you had better finish nowyou say the ring is dangerous ,  far more dangerous than i guessin what wayit is far more powerful than i ever dared to think at first ,  so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed itit would possess himthe lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full - grown ,  and to the elven - smiths they were but trifles ñ yet still to my mind dangerous for mortalsbut the great rings ,  the rings of power ,  they were perilousand if he often uses the ring to make himself invisible ,  he fades :  he becomes in the end invisible permanently ,  and walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the ringsyes ,  sooner or later ñ later ,  if he is strong or well - meaning to begin with ,  but neither strength nor good purpose will last ñ sooner or later the dark power will devour himthere was another long silencethe sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the gardenhe thought the ring was very beautiful ,  and very useful at need ;  and if anything was wrong or queer ,  it was himselfhe said that it was  " growing on his mind "  ,  and he was always worrying about it ;  but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blamethough he had found out that the thing needed looking after ;  it did not seem always of the same size or weight ;  it shrank or expanded in an odd way ,  and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tighthe took all the credit for that to himself ,  and he was very proud of itthough he was getting restless and uneasythin and stretched he saida sign that the ring was getting controlbut if you mean  " known about this ring "  ,  well ,  i still do not know , one might saythere is a last test to makebut i no longer doubt my guessa shadow fell on my heart then ,  though i did not know yet what i fearedi wondered often how gollum came by a great ring ,  as plainly it was ñ that at least was clear from the firstthen i heard bilbo ' s strange story of how he had  " won "  it ,  and i could not believe itwhen i at last got the truth out of him ,  i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubtmuch like gollum with his  " birthday present "the lies were too much alike for my comfortclearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at oncethat was the first real warning i had that all was not welli told bilbo often that such rings were better left unused ;  but he resented it ,  and soon got angrythere was little else that i could doi could not take it from him without doing greater harm ;  and i had no right to do so anywayi could only watch and waiti might perhaps have consulted saruman the white ,  but something always held me backi have never heard of him beforeyet he is great among the wisehe is the chief of my order and the head of the councilhis knowledge is deep ,  but his pride has grown with it ,  and he takes ill any meddlingthe lore of the elven - rings ,  great and small ,  is his provincehe has long studied it ,  seeking the lost secrets of their making ;  but when the rings were debated in the council ,  all that he would reveal to us of his ring - lore told against my fearsso my doubt slept ñ but uneasilystill i watched and i waitedand the years passedyes ,  they passed ,  and they seemed not to touch himhe showed no signs of agethe shadow fell on me againbut i said to myself :   " after all he comes of a long - lived family on his mother ' s sidethere is time yetuntil that night when he left this househe said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of saruman could allayi knew at last that something dark and deadly was at workand i have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of itbe able to rest in peace ,  i meanamong the wise i am the only one that goes in for hobbit - lore :  an obscure branch of knowledge ,  but full of surprisessoft as butter they can be ,  and yet sometimes as tough as old tree - rootsi think it likely that some would resist the rings far longer than most of the wise would believei don ' t think you need worry about bilbootherwise ,  he might live on for years ,  quite happily :  just stop as he was when he parted with itfor he gave it up in the end of his own accord :  an important pointno ,  i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more ,  once he had let the thing goit is for you that i feel responsibleit would be a grievous blow to the world ,  if the dark power overcame the shire ;  if all your kind ,  jolly ,  stupid bolgers ,  hornblowers ,  boffins ,  bracegirdles ,  and the rest ,  not to mention the ridiculous bagginses ,  became enslavedyou should be thankfulbut your safety has passedhe does not need you ñ he has many more useful servants ñ but he won ' t forget you againand hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and freethere is such a thing as malice and revengei still don ' t understand what all this has to do with bilbo and myself ,  and our ringi was not sure of it myself when i was last here ;  but the time has come to speakgive me the ring for a momenthe unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizardit felt suddenly very heavy ,  as if either it or frodo himself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch itgandalf held it upit looked to be made of pure and solid goldit is quite plain ,  and it never shows a scratch or sign of wearfrodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs ;  but gandalf held him backno apparent change came over the ringafter a while gandalf got up ,  closed the shutters outside the window ,  and drew the curtainsthe room became dark and silent ,  though the clack of sam ' s shears ,  now nearer to the windows ,  could still be heard faintly from the gardenfor a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire ;  then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs ,  and at once picked it upfrodo gaspedit is quite cool ,  '  said gandalfthey shone piercingly bright ,  and yet remote ,  as if out of a great depththe letters are elvish ,  of an ancient mode ,  but the language is that of mordor ,  which i will not utter herebut this in the common tongue is what is said ,  close enough :           one ring to rule them all ,  one ring to find them ,            one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themit is only two lines of a verse long known in elven - lore :           three rings for the elven - kings under the sky ,             seven for the dwarf - lords in their halls of stone ,            nine for mortal men doomed to die ,             one for the dark lord on his dark throne           in the land of mordor where the shadows lieone ring to rule them allone ring to find them ,             one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them           in the land of mordor where the shadows liethis is the one ring that he lost many ages ago ,  to the great weakening of his powerhe greatly desires it ñ but he must not get itfear seemed to stretch out a vast hand ,  like a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf himthe beginnings lie back in the black years ,  which only the lore - masters now rememberif i were to tell you all that tale ,  we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winterthe rumours that you have heard are true :  he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordorthat name even you hobbits have heard of ,  like a shadow on the borders of old storiesalways after a defeat and a respite ,  the shadow takes another shape and grows againbut that is not for them to decideall we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given ,  usand already ,  frodo ,  our time is beginning to look blackthe enemy is fast becoming very stronghis plans are far from ripe ,  i think ,  but they are ripeningwe shall be hard put to itwe should be very hard put to it ,  even if it were not for this dreadful chancehe lacks the one ringseven the dwarf - kings possessed ,  but three he has recovered ,  and the others the dragons have consumednine he gave to mortal men ,  proud and great ,  and so ensnared themlong ago they fell under the dominion of the one ,  and they became ringwraiths ,  shadows under his great shadow ,  his most terrible servantsit is many a year since the nine walked abroadyet who knowsas the shadow grows once more ,  they too may walk againwe will not speak of such things even in the morning of the shirethe three are hidden stillbut that no longer troubles himhe only needs the one ;  for he made that ring himself ,  it is his ,  and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it ,  so that he could rule all the othersif he recovers it ,  then he will command them all again ,  wherever they be ,  even the three ,  and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare ,  and he will be stronger than everhe believed that the one had perished ;  that the elves had destroyed it ,  as should have been donebut he knows now that it has not perished ,  that it has been foundso he is seeking it ,  seeking it ,  and all his thought is bent on itit is his great hope and our great fearthe men of westernesse came to their aidthat is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall ;  for there was sorrow then too ,  and gathering dark ,  but great valour ,  and great deeds that were not wholly vainone day ,  perhaps ,  i will tell you all the tale ,  or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it bestit was gil - galad ,  elven - king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew sauron ,  though they themselves perished in the deed ;  and isildur elendil ' s son cut the ring from sauron ' s hand and took it for his ownthen sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years ,  until his shadow took shape again in mirkwoodit fell into the great river ,  anduin ,  and vanishedfor isildur was marching north along the east banks of the river ,  and near the gladden fields he was waylaid by the orcs of the mountains ,  and almost all his folk were slainhe leaped into the waters ,  but the ring slipped from his finger as he swam ,  and then the orcs saw him and killed him with arrowsbut at last i can carry on the story ,  i thinki guess they were of hobbit - kind ;  akin to the fathers of the fathers of the stoors ,  for they loved the river ,  and often swam in it ,  or made little boats of reedsthere was among them a family of high repute ,  for it was large and wealthier than most ,  and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk ,  stern and wise in old lore ,  such as they hadthe most inquisitive and curious - minded of that family was called smèagolhe was interested in roots and beginnings ;  he dived into deep pools ;  he burrowed under trees and growing plants ;  he tunnelled into green mounds ;  and he ceased to look up at the hill - tops ,  or the leaves on trees ,  or the flowers opening in the air :  his head and his eyes were downwardon a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden fields ,  where there were great beds of iris and flowering reedsthere smèagol got out and went nosing about the banks but deal sat in the boat and fishedsuddenly a great fish took his hook ,  and before he knew where he was ,  he was dragged out and down into the water ,  to the bottomthen he let go of his line ,  for he thought he saw something shining in the river - bed ;  and holding his breath he grabbed at itwhen he washed the mud away ,  there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring ;  and it shone and glittered in the sun ,  so that his heart was gladbut smèagol had been watching him from behind a tree ,  and as deal gloated over the ring ,  smèagol came softly up behindi found this ,  and i ' m going to keep itthen he put the ring on his fingerbut smèagol returned alone ;  and he found that none of his family could see him ,  when he was wearing the ringhe was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it ;  and he used it to find out secrets ,  and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious useshe became sharp - eyed and keen - eared for all that was hurtfulthe ring had given him power according to his statureit is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned  ( when visible )  by all his relationsthey kicked him ,  and he bit their feethe took to thieving ,  and going about muttering to himself ,  and gurgling in his throatso they called him gollum ,  and cursed him ,  and told him to go far away ;  and his grandmother ,  desiring peace ,  expelled him from the family and turned him out of her holehe caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them rawone day it was very hot ,  and as he was bending over a pool ,  he felt a burning on the back of his head )  and a dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyeshe wondered at it ,  for he had almost forgotten about the sunthen for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at herand he thought suddenly :   " it would be cool and shady under those mountainsthe sun could not watch me therethe roots of those mountains must be roots indeed ;  there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginningthe ring went into the shadows with him ,  and even the maker ,  when his power had begun to grow again ,  could learn nothing of itdo you mean that this is the very gollum - creature that bilbo methow loathsomeand even bilbo ' s story suggests the kinshipthere was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories that was very similarthey understood one another remarkably well ,  very much better than a hobbit would understand ,  say ,  a dwarf ,  or an orc ,  or even an elfthink of the riddles they both knew ,  for one thingand hobbits don ' t cheatgollum meant to cheat all the timehe was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guardand i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim ,  but if he lost would not hurt himeven gollum was not wholly ruinedhe had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed  - as a hobbit mightthere was a little corner of his mind that was still his own ,  and light came through it ,  as through a chink in the dark :  light out of the pastit was actually pleasant ,  i think ,  to hear a kindly voice again ,  bringing up memories of wind ,  and trees ,  and sun on the grass ,  and such forgotten thingsunless it could be curedthere is little hope of that for himyet not no hopeno ,  not though he possessed the ring so long ,  almost as far back as he can rememberfor it was long since he had worn it much :  in the black darkness it was seldom neededcertainly he had never  " faded "he is thin and tough stillbut the thing was eating up his mind ,  of course ,  and the torment had become almost unbearablehe was altogether wretchedhe hated the dark ,  and he hated light more :  he hated everything ,  and the ring most of allbut if he hated it ,  why didn ' t he get rid of it ,  or go away and leave ithe could not get rid of ithe had no will left in the matterit may slip off treacherously ,  but its keeper never abandons itat most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone else ' s care ñ and that only at an early stage ,  when it first begins to gripbut as far as i know bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing ,  and really done ithe needed all my help ,  tooand even so he would never have just forsaken it ,  or cast it asideit was not gollum ,  frodo ,  but the ring itself that decided thingsthe ring left himit was the strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far :  bilbo ' s arrival just at that time ,  and putting his hand on it ,  blindly ,  in the darkthe ring was trying to get back to its masterit had slipped from isildur ' s hand and betrayed him ;  then when a chance came it caught poor deal ,  and he was murdered ;  and after that gollum ,  and it had devoured himit could make no further use of him :  he was too small and mean ;  and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool againso now ,  when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from mirkwood ,  it abandoned gollumonly to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable :  bilbo from the shirei can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo was meantto find the ring ,  and not by its makerin which case you also were meantto have itand that maybe an encouraging thoughtbut how have you learned all this about the ring ,  and about gollumdo you really know it all ,  or are you just guessing stilli knew much and i have learned much ,  '  he answeredthe history of elendil and isildur and the one ring is known to all the wiseyour ring is shown to be that one ring by the fire - writing alone ,  apart from any other evidencei have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final testit is the last proof ,  and all is now only too clearmaking out gollum ' s part ,  and fitting it into the gap in the history ,  required some thoughti may have started with guesses about gollum ,  but i am not guessing nowi have seen himthe obvious thing to do ,  of course ,  if one couldi tried long ago ;  but i have managed it at lastdo you know thatwhat i have told you is what gollum was willing to tell ñ though not ,  of course ,  in the way i have reported itgollum is a liar ,  and you have to sift his wordsfor instance ,  he called the ring his  " birthday present "  ,  and he stuck to thathe said it came from his grandmother ,  who had lots of beautiful things of that kinda ridiculous storyi have no doubt that smèagol ' s grandmother was a matriarch ,  a great person in her way ,  but to talk of her possessing many elven - rings was absurd ,  and as for giving them away ,  it was a liebut a lie with a grain of truthit was his birthdaydeal ought to have given the ring to himit had previously turned up just so as to be a presentit was his birthday present ,  and so on ,  and oni endured him as long as i could ,  but the truth was desperately important ,  and in the end i had to be harshi put the fear of fire on him ,  and wrung the true story out of him ,  bit by bit ,  together with much snivelling and snarlinghe thought he was misunderstood and ill - usedbut when he had at last told me his history ,  as far as the end of the riddle - game and bilbo ' s escape ,  he would not say any more ,  except in dark hintssome other fear was on him greater than minehe muttered that he was going to gel his own backpeople would see if he would stand being kicked ,  and driven into a hole and then robbedgollum had good friends now ,  good friends and very strongthey would help himbaggins would pay for itthat was his chief thoughthe hated bilbo and cursed his namewhat is more ,  he knew where he came fromoh yes ,  he came outhis longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear of the orcs ,  or even of the lightafter a year or two he left the mountainsyou see ,  though still bound by desire of it ,  the ring was no longer devouring him ;  he began to revive a littlehe felt old ,  terribly old ,  yet less timid ,  and he was mortally hungryhe found he could hide from daylight and moonshine ,  and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes ,  and catch small frightened or unwary thingshe grew stronger and bolder with new food and new airhe found his way into mirkwood ,  as one would expectit was difficult to learn anything from him for certain ,  for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threatslittle cheatnot a fair questionit cheated first ,  it didit broke the ruleswe ought to have squeezed it ,  yes preciousand we will ,  preciousi don ' t suppose you want any morei had weary days of itbut from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth ,  and even to the streets of dale ,  listening secretly and peeringwell ,  the news of the great events went far and wide in wilderland ,  and many had heard bilbo ' s name and knew where he came fromwe had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the westgollum ' s sharp ears would soon learn what he wantedi think gollum tried tohe set out and came back westward ,  as far as the great riverbut then he turned asidehe was not daunted by the distance ,  i am sureno ,  something else drew him awayso my friends think ,  those that hunted him for methrough mirkwood and back again it led them ,  though they never caught himthe wood was full of the rumour of him ,  dreadful tales even among beasts and birdsthe woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad ,  a ghost that drank bloodit climbed trees to find nests ;  it crept into holes to find the young ;  it slipped through windows to find cradlesit wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood - elves '  ken ,  and was lostand then i made a great mistakeyes ,  frodo ,  and not the first ;  though i fear it may prove the worsti let the matter bei let him go ;  for i had much else to think of at that time ,  and i still trusted the lore of sarumani have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous daysthe trail was long cold when i took it up again ,  after bilbo left hereand my search would have been in vain ,  but for the help that i had from a friend :  aragorn ,  the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the worldtogether we sought for gollum down the whole length of wilderland ,  without hope ,  and without successbut at last ,  when i had given up the chase and turned to other parts ,  gollum was foundmy friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with himhe only wept and called us cruel ,  with many a gollum in his throat ;  and when we pressed him he whined and cringed ,  and rubbed his long hands ,  licking his fingers as if they pained him ,  as if he remembered some old torturebut i am afraid there is no possible doubt :  he had made his slow ,  sneaking way ,  step by step ,  mile by mile ,  south ,  down at last to the land of mordorfrodo could hear his heart beatingeven outside everything seemed stillno sound of sam ' s shears could now be heardmordor draws all wicked things ,  and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them therethe ring of the enemy would leave its mark ,  too ,  leave him open to the summonsand all folk were whispering then of the new shadow in the south ,  and its hatred of the westthere were his fine new friends ,  who would help him in his revengein that land he would learn much ,  too much for his comfortand sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught ,  and taken ñ for examinationthat was the way of it ,  i fearwhen he was found he had already been there long ,  and was on his way backon some errand of mischiefbut that does not matter much nowhis worst mischief was donethrough him the enemy has learned that the one has been found againhe knows where isildur fellhe knows where gollum found his ringhe knows that it is a great ring ,  for it gave long lifehe knows that it is not one of the three ,  for they have never been lost ,  and they endure no evilhe knows that it is not one of the seven ,  or the nine ,  for they are accounted forhe knows that it is the oneand he has at last heard ,  i think ,  of hobbits and the shireindeed ,  frodo ,  i fear that he may even think that the long - unnoticed name of baggins has become importanto gandalf ,  best of friends ,  what am i to dofor now i am really afraidwhat am i to dowhat a pity that bilbo did not stab that vile creature ,  when he had a chanceit was pity that stayed his handpity ,  and mercy :  not to strike without needand he has been well rewarded ,  frodobe sure that he took so little hurt from the evil ,  and escaped in the end ,  because he began his ownership of the ring soi can ' t understand youdo you mean to say that you ,  and the elves ,  have let him live on after all those horrible deedsnow at any rate he is as bad as an orc ,  and just an enemyhe deserves deathi daresay he doesmany that live deserve deathand some that die deserve lifecan you give it to themthen do not be too eager to deal out death in judgementfor even the very wise cannot see all endsi have not much hope that gollum can be cured before he dies ,  but there is a chance of itand he is bound up with the fate of the ringmy heart tells me that he has some part to play yet ,  for good or ill ,  before the end ;  and when that comes ,  the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many ñ yours not leastin any case we did not kill him :  he is very old and very wretchedthe wood - elves have him in prison ,  but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise heartsi wish he had never found it ,  and that i had not got itwhy did you let me keep itwhy didn ' t you make me throw it away ,  or ,  or destroy ityou are not thinking of what you are sayingbut as for throwing it away ,  that was obviously wrongthese rings have a way of being foundin evil hands it might have done great evilworst of all ,  it might have fallen into the hands of the enemyindeed it certainly would ;  for this is the one ,  and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himselfbut there was so much at stake that i had to take some risk ñ though even when i was far away there has never been a day when the shire has not been guarded by watchful eyesas long as you never used it ,  i did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you ,  not for evil ,  not at any rate for a very long timeand you must remember that nine years ago ,  when i last saw you ,  i still knew little for certainif you had warned me ,  or even sent me a message ,  i would have done away with ithow would you do thathave you ever triedbut i suppose one could hammer it or melt itit now appeared plain and smooth ,  without mark or device that he could seethe gold looked very fair and pure ,  and frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour ,  how perfect was its roundnessit was an admirable thing and altogether preciouswhen he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the firebut he found now that he could not do so ,  not without a great strugglehe weighed the ring in his hand ,  hesitating ,  and forcing himself to remember all that gandalf had told him ;  and then with an effort of will he made a movement ,  as if to cast it away ñ but he found that he had put it back in his pocketgandalf laughed grimlyalready you too ,  frodo ,  cannot easily let it go ,  nor will to damage itand i could not  " make "  you ñ except by force ,  which would break your mindbut as for breaking the ring ,  force is uselesseven if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge - hammer ,  it would make no dint in itit cannot be unmade by your hands ,  or by minethis ring has already passed through it unscathed ,  and even unheatedbut there is no smith ' s forge in this shire that could change it at allnot even the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do thatit has been said that dragon - fire could melt and consume the rings of power ,  but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough ;  nor was there ever any dragon ,  not even ancalagon the black ,  who could have harmed the one ring ,  the ruling ring ,  for that was made by sauron himselfthere is only one way :  to find the cracks of doom in the depths of orodruin ,  the fire - mountain ,  and cast the ring in there ,  if you really wish to destroy it ,  to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for everi am not made for perilous questsi wish i had never seen the ringwhy did it come to mewhy was i chosenbut you have been chosen ,  and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you haveyou are wise and powerfulwill you not take the ringand over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadlyfor i do not wish to become like the dark lord himselfyet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity ,  pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do gooddo not tempt mei dare not take it ,  not even to keep it safe ,  unusedthe wish to wield it would be too great ,  for my strengthi shall have such need of itgreat perils lie before mesunlight streamed back again into the roomsam passed along the path outside whistlingbut i will always help youbut we must do something ,  soonthe enemy is movinggandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe ,  as if lost in thoughthis eyes seemed closed ,  but under the lids he was watching frodo intentlyfrodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth ,  until they filled all his vision ,  and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of firehe was thinking of the fabled cracks of doom and the terror of the fiery mountainhave you decided what to doas far as i understand what you have said ,  i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it ,  at least for the present ,  whatever it may do to mebut in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger ,  a danger to all that live near mei cannot keep the ring and stay herei ought to leave bag end ,  leave the shire ,  leave everything and go awaybut i don ' t feel like that nowi feel that as long as the shire lies behind ,  safe and comfortable ,  i shall find wandering more bearable :  i shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold ,  even if my feet cannot stand there againbut this would mean exile ,  a flight from danger into danger ,  drawing it after meand i suppose i must go alone ,  if i am to do that and save the shirebut i feel very small ,  and very uprooted ,  and well ñ desperatethe enemy is so strong and terribleit was so strong that it overcame his fear :  he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat ,  as bilbo had done on a similar morning long agoyou can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month ,  and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinchi hardly expected to get such an answer ,  not even from youbut bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir ,  though he little thought how important it would provei am afraid you are rightthe ring will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much longer ;  and for your own sake ,  as well as for others ,  you will have to go ,  and leave the name of baggins behind youthat name will not be safe to have ,  outside the shire or in the wildi will give you a travelling name nowwhen you go ,  go as mrnot if you know of anyone you can trust ,  and who would be willing to go by your side ñ and that you would be willing to take into unknown perilsbut if you look for a companion ,  be careful in choosingand be careful of what you say ,  even to your closest friendsthe enemy has many spies and many ways of hearingfrodo became aware that all was very quiet ,  inside and outsidegandalf crept to one side of the windowthen with a dart he sprang to the sill ,  and thrust a long arm out and downwardsthere was a squawk ,  and up came sam gamgee ' s curly head hauled by one earnow what may you be doinggandalf ,  sirleastways i was just trimming the grass - border under the window ,  if you follow meit is some time since i last heard the sound of your shearshow long have you been eavesdroppingi don ' t follow you ,  begging your pardonthere ain ' t no eaves at bag end ,  and that ' s a factwhat have you heard ,  and why did you listenfrodo ,  sirdon ' t let him turn me into anything unnaturalmy old dad would take on soi meant no harm ,  on my honour ,  sirbut just you up and answer his questions straight awaybilbo ,  sir ,  and dragons ,  and a fiery mountain ,  and ñ and elves ,  siri listened because i couldn ' t help myself ,  if you know what i meanlor bless me ,  sir ,  but i do love tales of that sortand i believe

seeminglyi tried not to ,  sir ,  but it burst out of me :  i was so upsethe had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of bag endbut '  ñ and here he looked hard at sam ñ  ' if you really care about me ,  you will keep that dead secretif you don ' t ,  if you even breathe a word of what you ' ve heard here ,  then i hope gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass - snakesi have thought of something better than thatsomething to shut your mouth ,  and punish you properly for listeningyou shall go away with mrchapter 3            three is company      ' you ought to go quietly ,  and you ought to go soon ,  '  said gandalftwo or three weeks had passed ,  and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to gobut it is difficult to do both ,  '  he objectedif i just vanish like bilbo ,  the tale will be all over the shire in no timei said soon ,  not instantlyif you can think of any way of slipping out of the shire without its being generally known ,  it will be worth a little delaybut you must not delay too longbag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years ,  and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the shirewhen autumn came ,  he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying ,  as it always did at that seasonhe had indeed privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday :  bilbo ' s one hundred and twenty - eighthit seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow himfollowing bilbo was uppermost in his mind ,  and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearablehe thought as little as possible about the ring ,  and where it might lead him in the endbut he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalfwhat the wizard guessed was always difficult to tellhe looked at frodo and smiledi am getting very anxiousin the mean - while ,  do take care ,  and don ' t let out any hint of where you are goingand see that sam gamgee does not talkif he does ,  i really shall turn him into a toadbut you are leaving the shire ñ and that should not be known ,  until you are far awayand you must go ,  or at least set out ,  either north ,  south ,  west or east ñ and the direction should certainly not be knownand by what shall i steerwhat is to be my questbilbo went to find a treasure ,  there and back again ;  but i go to lose one ,  and not return ,  as far as i can seeit may be your task to find the cracks of doom ;  but that quest may be for others :  i do not knowat any rate you are not ready for that long road yetthat journey should not prove too perilous ,  though the road is less easy than it was ,  and it will grow worse as the year failsi will take sam to visit the elves ;  he will be delightedone summer ' s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the ivy bush and green dragongiants and other portents on the borders of the shire were forgotten for more important matters :  mrfrodo was selling bag end ,  indeed he had already sold it ñ to the sackville - bagginsesfrodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the pricea few held the theory ñ supported by the nods and hints of mrbaggins himself ñ that frodo ' s money was running out :  he was going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in buckland among his brandybuck relationsbut so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most found this hard to believe ,  harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest :  to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalfthough he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day ,  it was well known that he was  ' hiding up in the bag end 'but however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry ,  there was no doubt about the fact :  frodo baggins was going back to bucklandto all but sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanentlythe decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him ;  for buckland was on the eastern borders of the shire ,  and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem crediblegandalf stayed in the shire for over two monthsthen one evening ,  at the end of june ,  soon after frodo ' s plan had been finally arranged ,  he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morningi have been idle longer than i shouldif i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once ,  i shall come back immediately ,  or at least send wordin the meanwhile stick to your plan ;  but be more careful than ever ,  especially of the ringlet me impress on you once more :  don ' t use iti think after all you may need my company on the roadthe shire had seldom seen so fair a summer ,  or so rich an autumn :  the trees were laden with apples ,  honey was dripping in the combs ,  and the corn was tall and fullautumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf againseptember was passing and there was still no news of himthe birthday ,  and the removal ,  drew nearer ,  and still he did not come ,  or send wordbag end began to be busysome of frodo ' s friends came to stay and help him with the packing :  there was fredegar bolger and folco boffin ,  and of course his special friends pippin took and merry brandybuckbetween them they turned the whole place upside - downon september 20th two covered carts went off laden to buckland ,  conveying the furniture and goods that frodo had not sold to his new home ,  by way of the brandywine bridgethe next day frodo became really anxious ,  and kept a constant look - out for gandalfthursday ,  his birthday morning ,  dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for bilbo ' s great partystill gandalf did not appearin the evening frodo gave his farewell feast :  it was quite small ,  just a dinner for himself and his four helpers ;  but he was troubled and fell in no mood for itthe thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his hearthe wondered how he would break it to themthe four younger hobbits were ,  however ,  in high spirits ,  and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalf ' s absencethe dining - room was bare except for a table and chairs ,  but the food was good ,  and there was good wine :  frodo ' s wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville - bagginsess get their claws on it ,  at any rate i have found a good home for thisit was the last drop of old winyardswhen they had sung many songs ,  and talked of many things they had done together ,  they toasted bilbo ' s birthday ,  and they drank his health and frodo ' s together according to frodo ' s customthen they went out for a sniff of air ,  and glimpse of the stars ,  and then they went to bedfrodo ' s party was over ,  and gandalf had not comethe next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggagemerry took charge of this ,  and drove off with fatty  ( that is fredegar bolger )frodo was restless and anxious ,  listening in vain for a sound of gandalfhe decided to wait until nightfallafter that ,  if gandalf wanted him urgently ,  he would go to crickhollow ,  and might even get there firstfor frodo was going on foothis plan ñ for pleasure and a last look at the shire as much as any other reason ñ was to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry ,  taking it fairly easyhe had not done any strenuous walking for a long time ,  and the reflection looked rather flabby ,  he thoughtafter lunch ,  the sackville - bagginses ,  lobelia and her sandy - haired son ,  lotho ,  turned up ,  much to frodo ' s annoyanceit was not polite ;  nor strictly true ,  for the sale of bag end did not take effect until midnightbut lobelia can perhaps be forgiven :  she had been obliged to wait about seventy - seven years longer for bag end than she once hoped ,  and she was now a hundred years oldanyway ,  she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off ;  and she wanted the keysit took a long while to satisfy her ,  as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through itin the end she departed with lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the gamgees '  in bagshot rowshe snorted ,  and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees capable of plundering the hole during the nightfrodo did not offer her any teahe took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchenit had been officially announced that sam was coming to buckland  ' to do for mrfrodo and look after his bit of garden '  ;  an arrangement that was approved by the gaffer ,  though it did not console him for the prospect of having lobelia as a neighbourthey left the washing up for lobeliapippin and sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porchpippin went out for a last stroll in the gardensam disappearedthe sun went downbag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelledfrodo wandered round the familiar rooms ,  and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls ,  and shadows creep out of the cornersit grew slowly dark indoorshe went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path ,  and then on a short way down the hill roadhe half expected to see gandalf come striding up through the duskthe sky was clear and the stars were growing brighti feel like walkingi can ' t bear any more hanging abouti am going to start ,  and gandalf must follow meone voice was certainly the old gaffer ' s ;  the other was strange ,  and somehow unpleasanthe could not make out what it said ,  but he heard the gaffer ' s answers ,  which were rather shrillthe old man seemed put outbaggins has gone awaywent this morning ,  and my sam went with him :  anyway all his stuff wentyes ,  sold out and gone ,  i tell ' eewhy ' s none of my business ,  or yoursthat ain ' t no secrethe ' s moved to bucklebury or some such place ,  away down yonderyes it is ñ a tidy wayi ' ve never been so far myself ;  they ' re queer folks in bucklandno ,  i can ' t give no messagegood night to youfrodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great reliefpippin was sitting on his pack in the porchsam was not therefrodo stepped inside the dark doorhe had been saying farewell to the beer - barrel in the cellari ' ll last for a bit now ,  sirwe are not going through the village tonighttoo many ears pricking and eyes pryingthey shouldered their packs and took up their sticks ,  and walked round the corner to the west side of bag endhe waved his hand ,  and then turned and  ( following bilbo ,  if he had known it )  hurried after peregrin down the garden - paththey jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields ,  passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grassesat the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lanethere they halted and adjusted the straps of their packspresently sam appeared ,  trotting quickly and breathing hard ;  his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders ,  and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag ,  which he called a hatin the gloom he looked very much like a dwarfmy packet is quite light ,  '  said sam stoutly and untruthfullyhe ' s got nothing except what he ordered us to packhe ' s been slack lately ,  and he ' ll feel the weight less when he ' s walked off some of his ownbut i was talking nonsensei suspect you have taken more than your share ,  sam ,  and i shall look into it at our next packingthen leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields againthey went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices ,  and night fell dark about themin their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic ringssince they were all hobbits ,  and were trying to be silent ,  they made no noise that even hobbits would heareven the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passingafter some time they crossed the water ,  west of hobbiton ,  by a narrow plank - bridgethe stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon ,  bordered with leaning alder - treesa mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the brandywine bridge ;  they were now in the tookland and bending south - eastwards they made for the green hill countryas they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the watersoon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land ,  and was followed by bywater beside its grey poolwhen the light of the last farm was far behind ,  peeping among the trees ,  frodo turned and waved a hand in farewellwhen they had walked for about three hours they restedthe night was clear ,  cool ,  and starry ,  but smoke - like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill - sides from the streams and deep meadowsthin - clad birches ,  swaying in a light wind above their heads ,  made a black net against the pale skythey ate a very frugal supper  ( for hobbits )  ,  and then went on againsoon they struck a narrow road ,  that went rolling up and down ,  fading grey into the darkness ahead :  the road to woodhall ,  and stock ,  and the bucklebury ferryit climbed away from the main road in the water - valley ,  and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards woody - end ,  a wild corner of the eastfarthingafter a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the nightit was very darkat first they talked ,  or hummed a tune softly together ,  being now far away from inquisitive earsthen they marched on in silence ,  and pippin began to lag behindat last ,  as they began to climb a steep slope ,  he stopped and yawnedare you going to sleep on your legsit is nearly midnightmerry expects us some time the day after tomorrow ;  but that leaves us nearly two days morewe ' ll halt at the first likely spotthere is a dry fir - wood just ahead ,  if i remember rightlyjust over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir - woodleaving the road they went into the deep resin - scented darkness of the trees ,  and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a firesoon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir - tree and they sat round it for a while ,  until they began to nodthen ,  each in an angle of the great tree ' s roots ,  they curled up in their cloaks and blankets ,  and were soon fast asleepthey set no watch ;  even frodo feared no danger yet ,  for they were still in the heart of the shirea few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died awaya fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffedi have heard of strange doings in this land ,  but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a treethree of themthere ' s something mighty queer behind thisthe morning came ,  pale and clammyfrodo woke up first ,  and found that a tree - root had made a hole in his back ,  and that his neck was stiffwhy didn ' t i drivethese tree - roots would do them goodit ' s a beautiful morninggel breakfast ready for half - past ninehave you got the bath - water hotfrodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over ,  and then walked off to the edge of the woodaway eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the worldtouched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy seaa little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappearedwhen he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire goingthey filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stoneit was icy cold ;  and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and handswhen their breakfast was over ,  and their packs all trussed up again ,  it was after ten o ' clock ,  and the day was beginning to turn fine and hotthey went down the slope ,  and across the stream where it dived under the road ,  and up the next slope ,  and up and down another shoulder of the hills ;  and by that time their cloaks ,  blankets ,  water ,  food ,  and other gear already seemed a heavy burdenthe day ' s march promised to be warm and tiring workafter some miles ,  however ,  the road ceased to roll up and down :  it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig - zagging sort of way ,  and then prepared to go down for the last timein front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland hazethey were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine riverthe road wound away before them like a piece of stringit is high time for lunchsam stood by himhis round eyes were wide open ñ for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizonfrodo was silenthe too was gazing eastward along the road ,  as if he had never seen it beforesuddenly he spoke ,  aloud but as if to himself ,  saying slowly :           the road goes ever on and on            down from the door where it begannow far ahead the road has gone ,             and i must follow ,  if i can ,            pursuing it with weary feet ,             until it joins some larger way ,            where many paths and errands meetand whither theni cannot sayit does not sound altogether encouragingit came to me then ,  as if i was making it up ;  but i may have heard it long agocertainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the last years ,  before he went awayhe used often to say there was only one road ;  that it was like a great river :  its springs were at every doorstep ,  and every path was its tributarydo you realize that this is the very path that goes through mirkwood ,  and that if you let it ,  it might take you to the lonely mountain or even further and to worse placesthe others followed his example ,  putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the roadafter a rest they had a good lunch ,  and then more restthe sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hillso far they had not met a soul on the roadthis way was not much used ,  being hardly fit for carts ,  and there was little traffic to the woody endthey had been jogging along again for an hour or more when sam stopped a moment as if listeningthey were now on level ground ,  and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass - land sprinkled with tall trees ,  outliers of the approaching woodsthey looked back ,  but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing fari am sick of my doings being noticed and discussedand if it is gandalf ,  '  he added as an afterthought ,   ' we can give him a little surprise ,  to pay him out for being so latelet ' s get out of sightthere they lay flatfrodo hesitated for a second :  curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hidethe sound of hoofs drew nearerjust in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the roadthen he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great rootsround the corner came a black horse ,  no hobbit - pony but a full - sized horse ;  and on it sat a large man ,  who seemed to crouch in the saddle ,  wrapped in a great black cloak and hood ,  so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below ;  his face was shadowed and invisiblewhen it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stoppedthe riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed ,  as if listeningfrom inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent ;  the head turned from side to side of the roada sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo ,  and he thought of his ringhe hardly dared to breathe ,  and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his handhe felt that he had only to slip it on ,  and then he would be safethe advice of gandalf seemed absurdbilbo had used the ringat that moment the rider sat up ,  and shook the reinsthe horse stepped forward ,  walking slowly at first ,  and then breaking into a quick trotfrodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider ,  until he dwindled into the distancehe could not be quite sure ,  but it seemed to him that suddenly ,  before it passed out of sight ,  the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the rightpippin and sam had remained flat in the grass ,  and had seen nothing ;  so frodo described the rider and his strange behaviouri ' ve never seen or fell anything like it in the shire beforebut i have never heard of anything like this rideri wonder where he comes fromit ' s from hobbiton that this here black rider comes ,  unless there ' s more than oneand i know where he ' s going toit was like this :  when i got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key ,  my dad ,  he says to me :  hello ,  sami thought you were away with mrfrodo this morningthere ' s been a strange customer asking for mrbaggins of bag end ,  and he ' s only just gonei ' ve sent him on to buckleburynot that i liked the sound of himhe seemed mighty put out ,  when i told him mrbaggins had left his old home for goodhissed at me ,  he didit gave me quite a shudderwhat sort of a fellow was hesays i to the gafferi don ' t know ,  says he ;  but he wasn ' t a hobbithe was tall and black - like ,  and he stooped aver mei reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign partshe spoke funnythe gaffer is getting old ,  and more than a bit blind ,  and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the hill and found him taking the air at the end of our rowi hope he hasn ' t done no harm ,  sir ,  nor mei wish i had ,  or you had told me about it beforei might have been more careful on the roadyou can keep your secret for the present ,  if you want to be mysteriousin the meanwhile what are we to doi should like a bite and a sup ,  but somehow i think we had better move on from hereyour talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled mewe ought to do a good step more todaybuckland is still miles awaythey now kept a stone ' s throw to the left of the road ,  and kept out of sight of it as much as they couldbut this hindered them ;  for the grass was thick and tussocky ,  and the ground uneven ,  and the trees began to draw together into thicketsthe sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs ,  and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some milesat that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the yale making for stock ;  but a lane branched right ,  winding through a wood of ancient oak - trees on its way to woodhallnot far from the road - meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree :  it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long - fallen limbs ;  but it was hollow ,  and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the roadthe hobbits crept inside ,  and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed woodthey rested and had a light meal ,  talking quietly and listening from time to timetwilight was about them as they crept back to the lanethe west wind was sighing in the branchesleaves were whisperingsoon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the duska star came out above the trees in the darkening east before themthey went abreast and in step ,  to keep up their spiritsafter a time ,  as the stars grew thicker and brighter ,  the feeling of disquiet left them ,  and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofsthey began to hum softly ,  as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along ,  especially when they are drawing near to home at nightwith most hobbits it is a supper - song or a bed - song ;  but these hobbits hummed a walking - song  ( though not ,  of course ,  without any mention of supper and bed )bilbo baggins had made the words ,  to a tune that was as old as the hills ,  and taught it to frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water - valley and talked about adventureupon the hearth the fire is red ,            beneath the roof there is a bed ;            but not yet weary are our feet ,            still round the corner we may meet           a sudden tree or standing stone           that none have seen but we alonetree and flower and leaf and grass ,             let them passlet them passhill and water under sky ,             pass them bypass them bystill round the corner there may wait           a new road or a secret gate ,            and though we pass them by today ,            tomorrow we may come this way           and take the hidden paths that run           towards the moon or to the sunapple ,  thorn ,  and nut and sloe ,             let them golet them gosand and stone and pool and dell ,             fare you wellfare you wellhome is behind ,  the world ahead ,            and there are many paths to tread           through shadows to the edge of night ,            until the stars are all alightthen world behind and home ahead ,            we ' ll wander back to home and bedmist and twilight ,  cloud and shade ,             away shall fadeaway shall fadefire and lamp ,  and meat and bread ,             and then to bedand then to bedthe song endedand now to bedthere was a sound of hoofs in the lane ,  some way behind ,  but coming slow and clear down the windquickly and quietly they slipped off the path ,  and ran into the deeper shade under the oak - treesthey had no time to find any hiding - place better than the general darkness under the trees ;  sam and pippin crouched behind a large tree - bole ,  while frodo crept back a few yards towards the laneit showed grey and pale ,  a line of fading light through the woodabove it the stars were thick in the dim sky ,  but there was no moonthe sound of hoofs stoppedas frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees ,  and then haltit looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadowthe black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path ,  and it swayed from side to sidefrodo thought he heard the sound of snufflingthe shadow bent to the ground ,  and then began to crawl towards himonce more the desire to slip on the ring came over frodo ;  but this time it was stronger than beforeso strong that ,  almost before he realized what he was doing ,  his hand was groping in his pocketbut at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughterclear voices rose and fell in the starlit airthe black shadow straightened up and retreatedit climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other sidefrodo breathed againthey don ' t live in the shire ,  but they wander into it in spring and autumn ,  out of their own lands away beyond the tower hillsi am thankful that they doyou did not see ,  but that black rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song beganas soon as he heard the voices he slipped awaythey are coming this way ,  '  said frodoone clear voice rose now above the othersit was singing in the fair elven - tongue ,  of which frodo knew only a little ,  and the others knew nothingyet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itself in their thought into words which they only partly understoodthis was the song as frodo heard it :           snow - whitesnow - whiteo lady clearo queen beyond the western seaso light to us that wander here            amid the world of woven treesclear are thy eyes and bright thy breathsnow - whitesnow - whitewe sing to thee            in a far land beyond the seao stars that in the sunless year            with shining hand by her were sawn ,            in windy fields now bright and clear            we see your silver blossom blownwe still remember ,  we who dwell           in this far land beneath the trees ,             thy starlight on the western seasthe song endedthey spoke the name of elberethnot many now remain in middle - earth ,  east of the great seathis is indeed a strange chancebefore long the elves came down the lane towards the valleythey passed slowly ,  and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyesthey bore no lights ,  yet as they walked a shimmer ,  like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises ,  seemed to fall about their feetthey were now silent ,  and as the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughedor are you perhaps lostwe have not seen such a thing since bilbo went awaywhat is the meaning of iti like walking under the starsbut i would welcome your companywe are exiles ,  and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while ,  ere we return over the great seabut some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in rivendellcome now ,  frodo ,  tell us what you are doingfor we see that there is some shadow of fear upon youat length gildor turned to the hobbitsit is not our custom ,  but for this time we will lake you on our road ,  and you shall lodge with us tonight ,  if you willthis is good fortune beyond my hope ,  '  said pippinsam was speechlesshere is a scholar in the ancient tonguebilbo was a good masterhail ,  elf - friendyou had best walk in the middle so that you may not strayyou may be weary before we haltwhere are you goingit is some miles ,  but you shall have rest at the end of it ,  and it will shorten your journey tomorrowpippin soon began to feel sleepy ,  and staggered once or twice ;  but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fallsam walked along at frodo ' s side ,  as if in a dream ,  with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joythe woods on either side became denser ;  the trees were now younger and thicker ;  and as the lane went lower ,  running down into a fold of the hills ,  there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either handat last the elves turned aside from the patha green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right ;  and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river - valleysuddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees ,  and before them lay a wide space of grass ,  grey under the nighton three sides the woods pressed upon it ;  but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees ,  growing at the bottom of the slope ,  were below their feetbeyond ,  the low lands lay dim and flat under the starsnearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhallthe elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices ;  they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbitsfrodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets ,  and drowsiness stole over themthe night grew on ,  and the lights in the valley went outpippin fell asleep ,  pillowed on a green hillockaway high in the east swung remmirath ,  the netted stars ,  and slowly above the mists red borgil rose ,  glowing like a jewel of firethen by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil ,  and there leaned up ,  as he climbed over the rim of the world ,  the swordsman of the sky ,  menelvagor with his shining beltthe elves all burst into songsuddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red lightnow is the time for speech and merrimenthe shiveredat the south end of the greensward there was an openingthere the green floor ran on into the wood ,  and formed a wide space like a hall ,  roofed by the boughs of treestheir great trunks ran like pillars down each sidein the middle there was a wood - fire blazing ,  and upon the tree - pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadilythe elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunkssome went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink ;  others brought food on heaped plates and dishesif ever you are our guests at home ,  we will treat you betterpippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink ,  for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf - faces ,  and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dreambut he remembered that there was bread ,  surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving ;  and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens ;  he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught ,  cool as a clear fountain ,  golden as a summer afternoonsam could never describe in words ,  nor picture clearly to himself ,  what he felt or thought that night ,  though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his lifethe nearest he ever got was to say :   ' well ,  sir ,  if i could grow apples like that ,  i would call myself a gardenerbut it was the singing that went to my heart ,  if you know what i meanhe knew a little of the elf - speech and listened eagerlynow and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own languagethey smiled at him and said laughing :   ' here is a jewel among hobbitssam refused to leave his masterwhen pippin had gone ,  he came and sat curled up at frodo ' s feet ,  where at last he nodded and closed his eyesfrodo remained long awake ,  talking with gildorthey spoke of many things ,  old and new ,  and frodo questioned gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the shirethe tidings were mostly sad and ominous :  of gathering darkness ,  the wars of men ,  and the flight of the elvesat last frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart :       ' tell me ,  gildor ,  have you ever seen bilbo since he left ushe said farewell to us on this very spotbut i saw him once again ,  far from hereyou are leaving the shire ,  and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek ,  or accomplish what you intend ,  or that you will ever returnis not that soand i warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you ,  and upon either sidei feared that they were servants of the enemywhat are the black ridersfor it seems to me that you have set out only just in time ,  if indeed you are in timeyou must now make haste ,  and neither stay nor turn back ;  for the shire is no longer any protection to youcan ' t a hobbit walk from the water to the river in peacethe wide world is all about you :  you can fence yourselves in ,  but you cannot for ever fence it outwhat can i do nowmy plan was to leave the shire secretly ,  and make my way to rivendell ;  but now my footsteps are dogged ,  before ever i get to bucklandbut if you desire clearer counsel ,  you should ask gandalfi do not know the reason for your flight ,  and therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail youthese things gandalf must knowi suppose that you will see him before you leave the shirebut that is another thing that makes me anxiousi have been expecting gandalf for many dayshe was to have come to hobbiton at the latest two nights ago ;  but he has never appearednow i am wondering what can have happenedshould i wait for himbut it is said :  do not meddle in the affairs of wizards ,  for they are subtle and quick to angerthe choice is yours :  to go or waitbut what would youyou have not told me all concerning yourself ;  and how then shall i choose better than youbut if you demand advice ,  i will for friendship ' s sake give iti think you should now go at once ,  without delay ;  and if gandalf does not come before you set out ,  then i also advise this :  do not go alonetake such friends as are trusty and willingnow you should be grateful ,  for i do not give this counsel gladlythe elves have their own labours and their own sorrows ,  and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits ,  or of any other creatures upon earthour paths cross theirs seldom ,  by chance or purposein this meeting there may be more than chance ;  but the purpose is not clear to me ,  and i fear to say too muchif i take your advice i may not see gandalf for a long while ,  and i ought to know what is the danger that pursues mespeak no words to themthey are deadlyask no more of mebut my heart forbodes that ,  ere all is ended ,  you ,  frodo son of drogo ,  will know more of these fell things than gildor inglorionmay elbereth protect youin the morning we shall have gone ;  but we will send our messages through the landsthe wandering companies shall know of your journey ,  and those that have power for good shall be on the watchi name you elf - friend ;  and may the stars shine upon the end of your roadseldom have we had such delight in strangers ,  and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the worldchapter 4            a short cut to mushrooms     in the morning frodo woke refreshedhe was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground ;  his bed was of fern and grass ,  deep and soft and strangely fragrantthe sun was shining through the fluttering leaves ,  which were still green upon the treehe jumped up and went outsam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the woodpippin was standing studying the sky and weatherthere was no sign of the elvesthe bread tastes almost as good as it did last nighti did not want to leave you any ,  but sam insistedunder the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to himi am sure it is very importanti don ' t want to answer a string of questions while i am eatingi want to thinkfrom frodo ' s mind the bright morning ñ treacherously bright ,  he thought ñ had not banished the fear of pursuit ;  and he pondered the words of gildorthe merry voice of pippin came to himhe was running on the green turf and singingi could notto take them into exile ,  where hunger and weariness may have no cure ,  is quite another ñ even if they are willing to comethe inheritance is mine alonei don ' t think i ought even to take sami am leaving the shire as soon as ever i can ñ in fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at crickhollow ,  if it can be helpedmost likely neither of us will come backthey said to mei never mean toi am going with him ,  if he climbs to the moon ,  and if any of those black rulers try to stop him ,  they ' ll have sam gamgee to reckon with ,  i saidthey laughedwe had some talk last night ;  and they seemed to know you were going away ,  so i didn ' t see the use of denying itwonderful folk ,  elves ,  sirthey are quite different from what i expected ñ so old and young ,  and so gay and sad ,  as it wereit did not sound like the voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knewbut it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there ,  except that his face was unusually thoughtfuli don ' t know how to say it ,  but after last night i feel differenti seem to see ahead ,  in a kind of wayi know we are going to take a very long road ,  into darkness ;  but i know i can ' t turn backit isn ' t to see elves now ,  nor dragons ,  nor mountains ,  that i want ñ i don ' t rightly know what i want :  but i have something to do before the end ,  and it lies ahead ,  not in the shirei must see it through ,  sir ,  if you understand mebut i understand that gandalf chose me a good companioni am contentwe will go togetherthen standing up he looked over the land ahead ,  and called to pippinwe slept late ;  and there are a good many miles to goand i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possiblei am not going out of the way ,  back to the road we left last night :  i am going to cut straight across country from hereit goes round the north end of the marish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stockbut that is miles out of the waywe could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the ferry from where we standand if you are worrying about black riders ,  i can ' t see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a fieldbut it is hardi had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before sundownthe best beer in the eastfarthing ,  or used to be :  it is a long time since i tasted itat all costs we must keep you away from the golden perchwe want to get to bucklebury before darkwhat do you say ,  samfrodo ,  '  said sam  ( in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing )it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before ;  but clouds were beginning to come up from the westit looked likely to turn to rainthe hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees belowtheir course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left ,  and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills ,  until they reached the flats beyondthen they could make straight for the ferry over country that was open ,  except for a few ditches and fencesfrodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight linehe soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appearedthere were no paths in the undergrowth ,  and they did not get on very fastwhen they had struggled to the bottom of the bank ,  they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with bramblesmost inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosenthey could not jump over it ,  nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet ,  scratched ,  and muddythey halted ,  wondering what to dosam gamgee looked backthrough an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed downthey all looked ,  and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standingbeside it stooped a black figurethey at once gave up any idea of going backfrodo led the way ,  and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the streamthe short cut has gone crooked already ;  but we got under cover only just in timeyou ' ve got sharp ears ,  sam :  can you hear anything comingwe had better be going onthey had packs to carry ,  and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them throughthey were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind ,  and the air was still and stuffywhen they forced their way at last into more open ground ,  they were hot and tired and very scratched ,  and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were goingthe banks of the stream sank ,  as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower ,  wandering off towards the marish and the riverbeyond that they came again to a belt of trees :  tall oaks ,  for the most part ,  with here and there an elm tree or an ashthe ground was fairly level ,  and there was little undergrowth ;  but the trees were loo close for them to see far aheadthe leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind ,  and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast skythen the wind died away and the rain came streaming downthey trudged along as fast as they could ,  over patches of grass ,  and through thick drifts of old leaves ;  and all about them the rain pattered and trickledthey did not talk ,  but kept glancing back ,  and from side to sideafter half an hour pippin said :   ' i hope we have not turned too much towards the south ,  and are not walking longwise through this woodit is not a very broad belt  - i should have said no more than a mile at the widest ñ and we ought to have been through it by nowlet us keep on as we are goingi am not sure that i want to come out into the open yetthen the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessenedit was now past mid - day ,  and they felt it was high time for lunchthey halted under an elm tree :  its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick ,  and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and shelteredwhen they came to make their meal ,  they found that the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink ,  pale golden in colour :  it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers ,  and was wonderfully refreshingvery soon they were laughing ,  and snapping their fingers at rain ,  and at black ridersthe last few miles ,  they felt ,  would soon be behind themfrodo propped his back against the tree - trunk ,  and closed his eyessam and pippin sat near ,  and they began to hum ,  and then to sing softly :           hoto the bottle i go           to heal my heart and drown my woerain may fall and wind may blow ,            and many miles be still to go ,            but under a tall tree i will lie ,            and let the clouds go sailing bythey began again louderthey stopped short suddenlyfrodo sprang to his feeta long - drawn wail came down the wind ,  like the cry of some evil and lonely creatureit rose and fell ,  and ended on a high piercing noteeven as they sat and stood ,  as if suddenly frozen ,  it was answered by another cry ,  fainter and further off ,  but no less chilling to the bloodthere was then a silence ,  broken only by the sound of the wind in the leavesbut no hobbit has such a voicethey were all thinking of the riders ,  but no one spoke of themthey were now reluctant either to stay or go on ;  but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the ferry ,  and it was best to go sooner and in daylightin a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were offbefore long the wood came to a sudden endwide grass - lands stretched before themthey now saw that they had ,  in fact ,  turned too much to the southaway over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of bucklebury across the river ,  but it was now to their leftcreeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees ,  they set off across the open as quickly as they couldat first they felt afraid ,  away from the shelter of the woodfar back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfastedfrodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky ;  but there was no sign of onethe sun escaping from the breaking clouds ,  as it sank towards the hills they had left ,  was now shining brightly againtheir fear left them ,  though they still felt uneasybut the land became steadily more tame and well - orderedsoon they came into well - tended fields and meadows :  there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainageeverything seemed quiet and peaceful ,  just an ordinary corner of the shiretheir spirits rose with every stepthe line of the river grew nearer ;  and the black riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behindthey passed along the edge of a huge turnip - field ,  and came to a stout gatebeyond it a rutted lane ran between low well - laid hedges towards a distant clump of treespippin stoppedthat ' s his farm away there in the treesthe others looked at him in surpriseof course he ' s a terror to trespassers ,  and keeps ferocious dogs ñ but after all ,  folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guardi have avoided his farm for years and yearshe caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms ,  when i was a youngster at brandy hallon the last occasion he beat me ,  and then took me and showed me to his dogsnow see him offi have never got over the fright ñ though i daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have touched meespecially if you are coming back to live in bucklandold maggot is really a stout fellow ñ if you leave his mushrooms alonelet ' s get into the lane and then we shan ' t be trespassingif we meet him ,  i ' ll do the talkinghe is a friend of merry ' s ,  and i used to come here with him a good deal at one timethe maggots ,  and the puddifoots of stock ,  and most of the inhabitants of the marish ,  were house - dwellers ;  and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round itthere was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lanesuddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out ,  and a loud voice was heard shouting :   ' gripcome on ,  ladsthe gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane ,  and dashed towards the travellers ,  barking fiercelythey took no notice of pippin ;  but sam shrank against the wall ,  while two wolvish - looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously ,  and snarled if he movedthe largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of frodo ,  bristling and growlingthrough the gate there now appeared a broad thick - set hobbit with a round red faceand who may you be ,  and what may you be wantingthe farmer looked at him closelyperegrin took ,  i should sayit ' s lucky for you that i know youi was just going out to set my dogs on any strangersthere are some funny things going on todayof course ,  we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at timestoo near the river ,  '  he said ,  shaking his headhe won ' t cross my land without leave a second time ,  not if i can stop ithe was a funny customer and asking funny questionsbut perhaps you ' ll come along inside ,  and we ' ll pass the news more comfortablei ' ve a drop of good ale on tap ,  if you and your friends are willing ,  mrthe farmer laughedhere ,  grippippin introduced the other two to the farmerfrodo baggins ,  '  he saidfor a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused ,  and that the dogs would be told to see him offbut farmer maggot took him by the armbaggins is itcome insidewe must have a talkmaggot brought out beer in a huge jug ,  and filled four large mugsit was a good brew ,  and pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the golden perchsam sipped his beer suspiciouslyhe had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the shire ;  and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master ,  however long agoafter a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects  ( which were no worse than usual )  ,  farmer maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turnperegrin ,  '  he said ,   ' where might you be coming from ,  and where might you be going towere you coming to visit '  mefor ,  if so ,  you had gone past my gate without my seeing youbut that was quite by accidentwe lost our way in the woods ,  back near woodhall ,  trying to take a short cut to the ferryyou have leave to walk over my land ,  if you have a mind ,  mrand you ,  mrbaggins ñ though i daresay you still like mushroomsi recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one of the worst young rascals of bucklandbut it wasn ' t mushrooms i was thinking ofi had just heard the name baggins before you turned upwhat do you think that funny customer asked meall black he was himself ,  too ,  and cloaked and hooded up ,  as if he did not want to be knownwe don ' t see many of the big folk over the border ;  and anyway i had never heard of any like this black fellowthe black fellow sat quite stilli could not see any face ,  for his hood fell down so low ;  and i felt a sort of shiver down my backbut i did not see why he should come riding over my land so boldyou ' re in the wrong part of the shireyou had better go back west to hobbiton ñ but you can go by road this timehe is not far awayi wish to find himif he passes will you tell mei will come back with goldi give you one minute before i call all my dogsit might have been laughing ,  and it might notthen he spurred his great horse right at me ,  and i jumped out of the way only just in timei called the dogs ,  but he swung off ,  and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunderwhat do you think of thatfolk are queer up therewhen i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone off to that old mrbilbo ,  i said that you were going to find troublemark my words ,  this all comes of those strange doings of mrhis money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts ,  they saymaybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of hobbiton ,  as i hearfrodo ,  '  maggot went on ,   ' i '

fellows come after you again ,  i ' ll deal with themi ' ll say you ' re dead ,  or have left the shire ,  or anything you likeand that might be true enough ;  for as like as not it is old mrbilbo

you a good step ,  and it might also save you trouble of another sortthe sun was already behind the western hills ,  and the light was failingtwo of maggot ' s sons and his three daughters came in ,  and a generous supper was laid on the large tablethe kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mendedmaggot hustled in and outone or two other hobbits belonging to the farm - household came inin a short while fourteen sat down to eatthere was beer in plenty ,  and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon ,  besides much other solid farmhouse farethe dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked boneswhen they had finished ,  the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon readyit was dark in the yard ,  when the guests came outthey threw their packs on board and climbed inthe farmer sat in the driving - seat ,  and whipped up his two stout ponieshis wife stood in the light of the open doorthere was now no breath of wind stirring ;  the night was still and quiet ,  and a chill was in the airthey went without lights and took it slowlyafter a mile or two the lane came to an end ,  crossing a deep dike ,  and climbing a short slope up on to the high - banked causewaymaggot got down and took a good look either way ,  north and south ,  but nothing could be seen in the darkness ,  and there was not a sound in the still airthin strands of river - mist were hanging above the dikes ,  and crawling over the fieldswe ' ll hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonightthe hobbits wrapped themselves up ,  but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies '  hoofsthe waggon seemed slower than a snail to frodobeside him pippin was nodding towards sleep ;  but sam was staring forwards into the rising fogthey reached the entrance to the ferry lane at lastit was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their rightfarmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a haltthey were just beginning lo scramble out ,  when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading :  hoofs on the road aheadthe sound was coming towards themmaggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies '  heads ,  and peering forward into the gloomclip - clop ,  clip - clop came the approaching riderthe fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still ,  foggy airfrodo ,  '  said sam

dark cloaked shape in the mist ,  a yard or two aheadwhat do you want ,  and where are you goinghave you seen hima dark lantern was uncovered ,  and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmerwho did you think it wasas he came out of the mist and their fears subsided ,  he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit - sizehe was riding a pony ,  and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fogfrodo sprang out of the waggon to greet himwhen it grew foggy i came across and rode up towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditchesbut i ' m blest

large basket from under the seatmaggot put this up for mrbaggins ,  with her complimentsthey watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy nightsuddenly frodo laughed :  from the covered basket he held ,  the scent of mushrooms was risingchapter 5            a conspiracy unmasked      ' now we had better get home ourselves ,  '  said merrythere ' s something funny about all this ,  i see ;  but it must wait till we get inin a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river - bank ,  where there was a broad wooden landing - stagea large flat ferry - boat was moored beside itthe white bollards near the water ' s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high postsbehind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges ;  but the water before them was dark ,  with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bankthere seemed to be less fog on the further sidemerry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry ,  and the others followedmerry then pushed slowly off with a long polethe brandywine flowed slow and broad before themon the other side the bank was steep ,  and up it a winding path climbed from the further landinglamps were twinkling therebehind loomed up the buck hill ;  and out of it ,  through stray shrouds of mist ,  shone many round windows ,  yellow and redthey were the windows of brandy hall ,  the ancient home of the brandybuckslong ago gorhendad oldbuck ,  head of the oldbuck family ,  one of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the shire ,  had crossed the river ,  which was the original boundary of the land eastwardshe built  ( and excavated )  brandy hall ,  changed his name to brandybuck ,  and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent countryhis family grew and grew ,  and after his days continued to grow ,  until brandy hall occupied the whole of the low hill ,  and had three large front - doors ,  many side - doors ,  and about a hundred windowsthe brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow ,  and later to build ,  all round aboutthat was the origin of buckland ,  a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the old forest ,  a sort of colony from the shireits chief village was bucklebury ,  clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hallthe people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders ,  and the authority of the master of the hall  ( as the head of the brandybuck family was called )  was still acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rusheybut most of the folk of the old shire regarded the bucklanders as peculiar ,  half foreigners as it werethough ,  as a matter of fact ,  they were not very different from the other hobbits of the four farthingsexcept in one point :  they were fond of boats ,  and some of them could swimtheir land was originally unprotected from the east ;  but on that side they had built a hedge :  the high hayit had been planted many generations ago ,  and was now thick and tail ,  for it was constantly tendedit ran all the way from brandywine bridge ,  in a big loop curving away from the river ,  to haysend  ( where the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine )  :  well over twenty miles from end to endbut ,  of course ,  it was not a complete protectionthe forest drew close to the hedge in many placesthe bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark ,  and that also was not usual in the shirethe ferry - boat moved slowly across the waterthe buckland shore drew nearersam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river beforehe had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by :  his old life lay behind in the mists ,  dark adventure lay in fronthe scratched his head ,  and for a moment had a passing wish that mrfrodo could have gone on living quietly at bag endthe four hobbits stepped off the ferrymerry was tying it up ,  and pippin was already leading the pony up the path ,  when sam  ( who had been looking back ,  as if to take farewell of the shire )  said in a hoarse whisper :       ' look back ,  mrdo you see anythingbut as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that ,  as if searching the groundit then crawled ,  or went crouching ,  back into the gloom beyond the lampslet ' s get away at oncebut what have horses to do with itlet ' s get indoors and then we can talkyou and pippin know your way ;  so i ' ll just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are comingwe ' ll see about supper and thingsgive me that basketit was some distance from the brandywine to frodo ' s new house at crickhollowthey passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left ,  and on the outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road of buckland that ran south from the bridgehalf a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their rightthis they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the countryat last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedgenothing could be seen of the house in the dark :  it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedgefrodo had chosen it ,  because it stood in an out - of - the - way corner of the country ,  and there were no other dwellings close byyou could get in and out without being noticedit had been built a long while before by the brandybucks ,  for the use of guests ,  or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of brandy hall for a timeit was an old - fashioned countrified house ,  as much like a hobbit - hole as possible :  it was long and low ,  with no upper storey ;  and it had a roof of turf ,  round windows ,  and a large round dooras they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible ;  the windows were dark and shutteredfrodo knocked on the door ,  and fatty bolger opened ita friendly light streamed outthey slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light insidethey were in a wide hall with doors on either side ;  in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the houseafter all fatty and i only got here with the last cart - load yesterdayit did look like homemany of his own favourite things ñ or bilbo ' s things  ( they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling )  ñ were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag endit was a pleasant ,  comfortable ,  welcoming place ;  and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirementit seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble ;  and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon ,  indeed at onceyet that would have to be done that very night ,  before they all went to bedmerry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far endfirelight came out ,  and a puff of steamyou ' ll be last either way ,  master peregrinin that room there are three tubs ,  and a copper full of boiling waterthere are also towels ,  mats and soapget inside ,  and be quicksnatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowingthe voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of bilbo ' s favourite bath - songsfor the bath at close of day           that washes the weary mud awaya loon is he that will not sing :            owater hot is a noble thingsweet is the sound of falling rain ,            and the brook that leaps from hill to plain ;            but better than rain or rippling streams           is water hot that smokes and steamswater cold we may pour at need           down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed ;            but better is beer ,  if drink we lack ,            and water hot poured down the backwater is fair that leaps on high           in a fountain white beneath the sky ;            but never did fountain sound so sweet           as splashing hot

about supper and beer in the throatfrodo came out drying his hairthe stone floor was swimmingperegrin ,  '  he saidmaggot ,  a queen among farmers '  wivestake your greedy hands away ,  and i ' ll serve thema fact which partly explains young frodo ' s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the marish ,  and the wrath of the injured maggoton this occasion there was plenty for all ,  even according to hobbit standardsthere were also many other things to follow ,  and when they had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of contentthey pushed back the table ,  and drew chairs round the firei guess that you have been having adventures ,  which was not quite fair without mei want a full account ;  and most of all i want to know what was the matter with old maggot ,  and why he spoke to me like thathe sounded almost as if he was scared ,  if that is possiblesam gave various supporting nods and exclamationsfrodo remained silentwhat do you make of it all ,  frodoso far we have been given nothing more to go on than farmer maggot ' s guess that it has something to do with old bilbo ' s treasurei ' ve heard that he used to go into the old forest at one time ,  and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange thingsbut you can at least tell us ,  frodo ,  whether you think his guess good or badthere is a connexion with bilbo ' s old adventures ,  and the riders are looking ,  or perhaps one ought to say searching ,  for him or for mei also fear ,  if you want to know ,  that it is no joke at all ;  and that i am not safe here or anywhere elsethe others looked at him in silence ,  and exchanged meaning glances among themselvesmerry noddedi have got something to tell you allbut i don ' t know quite how to beginyou meant to leave the shire ,  of coursebut danger has come on you sooner than you expected ,  and now you are making up your mind to go at onceand you don ' t want towe are very sorry for youhis look of surprise was so comical that they laughedyou have not been nearly careful or clever enough for thatyou have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since aprilwe have constantly heard you muttering :   " shall i ever look down into that valley again ,  i wonder "  ,  and things like thatand pretending that you had come to the end of your money ,  and actually selling your beloved bag end to those sackville - bagginsesand all those close talks with gandalfi don ' t know what gandalf would sayis all the shire discussing my departure thenthe secret won ' t keep for long ,  of course ;  but at present it is ,  i think ,  only known to us conspiratorsafter all ,  you must remember that we know you well ,  and are often with youwe can usually guess what you are thinkingi knew bilbo ,  tooto tell you the truth ,  i had been watching you rather closely ever since he lefti thought you would go after him sooner or later ;  indeed i expected you to go sooner ,  and lately we have been very anxiouswe have been terrified that you might give us the slip ,  and go off suddenly ,  all on your own like he didever since this spring we have kept our eyes open ,  and done a good deal of planning on our own accountyou are not going to escape so easilyit is wretched for us all ,  but it is no use your trying to keep mesince you have guessed so much ,  please help me and do not hinder memerry and i are coming with yousam is an excellent fellow ,  and would jump down a dragon ' s throat to save you ,  if he did not trip over his own feet ;  but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventurei decided that long ago ,  tooyou speak of danger ,  but you do not understandthis is no treasure - hunt ,  no there - and - back journeyi am flying from deadly peril into deadly perilwe know the ring is no laughing - matter ;  but we are going to do our best to help you against the enemyi have known about the existence of the ring for years ñ before bilbo went away ,  in fact ;  but since he obviously regarded it as secret ,  i kept the knowledge in my head ,  until we formed our conspiracyi did not know bilbo ,  of course ,  as well as i know you ;  i was too young ,  and he was also more careful ñ but he was not careful enoughif you want to know how i first found out ,  i will tell youone day ,  a year before the party ,  i happened to be walking along the road ,  when i saw bilbo aheadsuddenly in the distance the ss appeared ,  coming towards usbilbo slowed down ,  and then hey prestohe vanishedi was so startled that i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion ;  but i got through the hedge and walked along the field insidei was peeping through into the road ,  after the ss had passed ,  and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappearedi caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser - pocketin fact ,  i confess that i spiedbut you must admit that it was very intriguing ,  and i was only in my teensi must be the only one in the shire ,  besides you frodo ,  that has ever seen the old fellow ' s secret bookis nothing safehe never left the book abouti wonder what became of iti should like another lookhave you got it ,  frodoit was not at bag endhe must have taken it awaythen we formed our conspiracy ;  and as we were serious ,  too ,  and meant business ,  we have not been too scrupulousyou are not a very easy nut to crack ,  and gandalf is worsebut if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator ,  i can produce himand he collected a lot ,  i can tell you ,  before he was finally caughtafter which ,  i may say ,  he seemed to regard himself as on parole ,  and dried upbut i meant no wrong to you ,  mrfrodo ,  nor to mrgandalf for that matterhe has some sense ,  mind you ;  and when you said go alone ,  he said nolake someone as you can trustsam looked at him unhappilyand you can trust us to keep any secret of yours ñ closer than you keep it yourselfbut you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone ,  and go off without a wordwe are your friends ,  frodoanyway :  there it iswe know most of what gandalf has told youwe know a good deal about the ringwe are horribly afraid ñ but we are coming with you ;  or following you like houndsgildor said you should take them as was willing ,  and you can ' t deny iti shall kick you hard to make surei will take gildor ' s adviceif the danger were not so dark ,  i should dance for joyeven so ,  i cannot help feeling happy ;  happier than i have felt for a long timei had dreaded this eveningthat ' s settledthree cheers for captain frodo and companymerry and pippin began a song ,  which they had apparently got ready for the occasionit was made on the model of the dwarf - song that started bilbo on his adventure long ago ,  and went to the same tune :           farewell we call to hearth and hallthough wind may blow and rain may fall ,            we must away ere break of day           far over wood and mountain tallto rivendell ,  where elves yet dwell           in glades beneath the misty fell ,            through moor and waste we ride in haste ,            and whither then we cannot tellwith foes ahead ,  behind us dread ,            beneath the sky shall be our bed ,            until at last our toil be passed ,            our journey done ,  our errand spedwe must awaywe must awaywe ride before the break of daythat was poetryalso gildor advised me not to waitbut i should very much like to see gandalfi could see that even gildor was disturbed when he heard that gandalf had never appearedit really depends on two thingshow soon could the riders get to buckleburyand how soon could we get offit will take a good deal of preparationi have prepared practically everythingthere are six ponies in a stable across the fields ;  stores and tackle are all packed ,  except for a few extra clothes ,  and the perishable foodwould it be safe to wait one day for gandalfthe gate - guards would not let them through by night ,  though they might break througheven in the daylight they would try to keep them out ,  i think ,  at any rate until they got a message through to the master of the hall ñ for they would not like the look of the riders ,  and would certainly be frightened by thembut ,  of course ,  buckland cannot resist a determined attack for longand it is possible that in the morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mrbaggins would be let throughit is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollowbut i am not going by road :  it would be safer to wait here than thatif i go through the north - gate my departure from buckland will be known at once ,  instead of being secret for several days at least ,  as it might beand what is more ,  the bridge and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched ,  whether any rider gets into buckland or notwe don ' t know how many there are ;  but there are at least two ,  and possibly morethe only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected directionit is quite as dangerous as black ridersit sounds very desperate ,  but i believe frodo is rightit is the only way of getting off without being followed at oncewith luck we might gel a considerable startyou ' ll gel lostpeople don ' t go in therewe have a private entrancefrodo went in once ,  long agoi have been in several times :  usually in daylight ,  of course ,  when the trees are sleepy and fairly quietstill ,  i am very glad someone is stopping behind ,  who can tell gandalf what you have done ,  when he turns up ,  as i am sure he will before longhis family came from the eastfarthing ,  from budgeford in bridgefields in fact ,  but he had never been over the brandywine bridgehis task ,  according to the original plans of the conspirators ,  was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk ,  and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that mrbaggins was still living at crickhollowhe had even brought along some old clothes of frodo ' s to help him in playing the partthey little thought how dangerous that part might provei don ' t know whether these riders can read or not ,  of course ,  but i should not have dared to risk a written message ,  in case they got in and searched the housebut if fatty is willing to hold the fort ,  and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we have gone ,  that decides mei am going into the old forest first thing tomorrowi shall call you all before the break of dayhis legs achedwas glad that he was riding in the morningeventually he fell into a vague dream ,  in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled treesdown below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snufflinghe felt sure they would smell him out sooner or laterthen he heard a noise in the distanceat first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forestthen he knew that it was not leaves ,  but the sound of the sea far - off ;  a sound he had never heard in waking life ,  though it had often troubled his dreamssuddenly he found he was out in the openthere were no trees after allhe was on a dark heath ,  and there was a strange salt smell in the airlooking up he saw before him a tall white tower ,  standing alone on a high ridgea great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the seahe started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower :  but suddenly a light came in the sky ,  and there was a noise of thunderchapter 6            the old forest     frodo woke suddenlyit was still dark in the roommerry was standing there with a candle in one hand ,  and banging on the door with the otherit is half past four and very foggysam is already getting breakfast readyeven pippin is upi am just going to saddle the ponies ,  and fetch the one that is to be the baggage - carrierwake that sluggard fattyat least he must get up and see us offfatty bolger was still yawningthey stole quietly out of the housemerry went in front leading a laden pony ,  and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house ,  and then cut across several fieldsthe leaves of trees were glistening ,  and every twig was dripping ;  the grass was grey with cold deweverything was still ,  and far - away noises seemed near and clear :  fowls chattering in a yard ,  someone closing a door of a distant housein their shed they found the ponies ;  sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits ,  not speedy ,  but good for a long day ' s workthey mounted ,  and soon they were riding off into the mist ,  which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind themafter riding for about an hour ,  slowly and without talking ,  they saw the hedge looming suddenly aheadit was tall and netted over with silver cobwebsa cutting had been made ,  at some distance from the hedge ,  and went sloping gently down into the groundit had walls of brick at the sides ,  which rose steadily ,  until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the hedge and came out in the hollow on the other sidehere fatty bolger haltedi only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is outbut good luck to you ñ today and every dayit was dark and dampat the far end it was closed by a gate of thick - set iron barsmerry got down and unlocked the gate ,  and when they had all passed through he pushed it to againit shut with a clang ,  and the lock clickedthe sound was ominousat any rate i don ' t believe thembut the forest is queereverything in it is very much more alive ,  more aware of what is going on ,  so to speak ,  than things are in the shireand the trees do not like strangersthey watch youthey are usually content merely to watch you ,  as long as daylight lasts ,  and don ' t do muchoccasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch ,  or stick a root out ,  or grasp at you with a long trailerbut at night things can be most alarming ,  or so i am toldi have only once or twice been in here after dark ,  and then only near the hedgei thought all the trees were whispering to each other ,  passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language ;  and the branches swayed and groped without any windthey do say the trees do actually move ,  and can surround strangers and hem them inin fact long ago they attacked the hedge :  they came and planted themselves right by it ,  and leaned over itbut the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees ,  and made a great bonfire in the forest ,  and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the hedgeafter that the trees gave up the attack ,  but they became very unfriendlythere is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was madebut something makes pathswhenever one comes inside one finds open tracks ;  but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashionnot far from this tunnel there is ,  or was for a long time ,  the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the bonfire glade ,  and then on more or less in our direction ,  east and a little norththat is the path i am going to try and findon the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest ,  a hundred yards and more beyond the hedge ;  but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the treeslooking back they could see the dark line of the hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about themlooking ahead they could see only tree - trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes :  straight or bent ,  twisted ,  leaning ,  squat or slender ,  smooth or gnarled and branched ;  and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy ,  shaggy growthsmerry alone seemed fairly cheerfulthere was no undergrowththe ground was rising steadily ,  and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller ,  darker ,  and thickerthere was no sound ,  except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leavesfor the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches ;  but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval ,  deepening to dislike and even enmitythe feeling steadily grew ,  until they found themselves looking up quickly ,  or glancing back over their shoulders ,  as if they expected a sudden blowthere was not as yet any sign of a path ,  and the trees seemed constantly to bar their waypippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer ,  and without warning let out a shoutjust let me pass through ,  will youthere was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than beforeit does more harm than goodmerry was looking from side to side ,  and seemed already uncertain which way to gopippin noticed itbut at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed aheadthere is the bonfire glade in front of us  ( or i hope so )  ,  but the path to it seems to have moved awaysuddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular spacethere was sky above them ,  blue and clear to their surprise ,  for down under the forest - roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mistthe sun was not ,  however ,  high enough yet to shine down into the clearing ,  though its light was on the tree - topsthe leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade ,  enclosing it with an almost solid wallno tree grew there ,  only rough grass and many tall plants :  stalky and faded hemlocks and wood - parsley ,  fire - weed seeding into fluffy ashes ,  and rampant nettles and thistlesa dreary place :  but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close forestthe hobbits felt encouraged ,  and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the skyat the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees ,  and a clear path beyond itthey could see it running on into the wood ,  wide in places and open above ,  though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughsup this path they rodethey were still climbing gently ,  but they now went much quicker ,  and with better heart ;  for it seemed to them that the forest had relented ,  and was going to let them pass unhindered after allbut after a while the air began to get hot and stuffythe trees drew close again on either side ,  and they could no longer see far aheadnow stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on themso silent was it that the fall of their ponies '  hoofs ,  rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots ,  seemed to thud in their earsfrodo tried to sing a song to encourage them ,  but his voice sank to a murmurwanderers in the shadowed land           despair notfor though dark they stand ,            all woods there be must end at last ,            and see the open sun go past :            the setting sun ,  the rising sun ,            the day ' s end ,  or the day begunfor east or west all woods must failfail  -  even as he said the word his voice faded into silencethe air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisomejust behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the paththe trees seemed to close in before themwait till we do get to the edge ,  and then we ' ll turn and give them a rousing chorusthe others did not answerthey were depresseda heavy weight was settling steadily on frodo ' s heart ,  and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the treeshe was ,  indeed ,  just about to stop and propose going back  ( if that was still possible )  ,  when things took a new turnthe path stopped climbing ,  and became for a while nearly levelthe dark trees drew aside ,  and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forwardbefore them ,  but some distance off ,  there stood a green hill - top ,  treeless ,  rising like a bald head out of the encircling woodthe path seemed to be making directly for itthey now hurried forward again ,  delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the forestthe path dipped ,  and then again began to climb upwards ,  leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillsidethere it left the trees and faded into the turfthe wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crownthe hobbits led their ponies up ,  winding round and round until they reached the topthere they stood and gazed about themthe air was gleaming and sunlit ,  but hazy ;  and they could not see to any great distancenear at hand the mist was now almost gone ;  though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood ,  and to the south of them ,  out of a deep fold cutting right across the forest ,  the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smokeit comes down out of the downs and flows south - west through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysendwe don ' t want to go that waythe withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood ñ the centre from which all the queerness comes ,  as it werethe sun on the hill - lop was now getting hotit must have been about eleven o ' clock ;  but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directionsin the west they could not make out either the line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond itnorthward ,  where they looked most hopefully ,  they could see nothing that might be the line of the great east road ,  for which they were makingthey were on an island in a sea of trees ,  and the horizon was veiledon the south - eastern side the ground fell very steeply ,  as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees ,  like island - shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep watersthey sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them ,  while they ate their mid - day mealas the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey - green lines of the downs that lay beyond the old forest on that sidethat cheered them greatly ;  for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood ' s borders ,  though they did not mean to go that way ,  if they could help it :  the barrow - downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit - legend as the forest itselfat length they made up their minds to go on againthe path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side ;  but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the rightsoon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the withywindle valley :  not at all the direction they wished lo takeafter some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward ;  for although they had not been able to see it from the hill - top ,  the road must lie that way ,  and it could not be many miles offalso northward ,  and to the left of the path ,  the land seemed lo be drier and more open ,  climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner ,  and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser woodat first their choice seemed to be good :  they got along at a fair speed ,  though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwardsbut after a time the trees began to close in again ,  just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangledthen deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly ,  like the ruts of great giant - wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with bramblesthese lay usually right across their line of march ,  and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again ,  which was troublesome and difficult with their ponieseach time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth ,  which somehow would not yield to the left ,  but only gave way when they turned to the right ;  and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bankeach time they clambered out ,  the trees seemed deeper and darker ;  and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way ,  and they were forced to the right and downwardsafter an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction ,  though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at allthey were being headed off ,  and were simply following a course chosen for them ñ eastwards and southwards ,  into the heart of the forest and not out of itthe afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet metit was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again ,  either forwards or backwards ,  without leaving their ponies and their baggage behindall they could do was to follow the fold ñ downwardsthe ground grew soft ,  and in places boggy ;  springs appeared in the banks ,  and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bedthen the ground began to fall rapidly ,  and the brook growing strong and noisy ,  flowed and leaped swiftly downhillthey were in a deep dim - lit gully over - arched by trees high above themafter stumbling along for some way along the stream ,  they came quite suddenly out of the gloomas if through a gate they saw the sunlight before themcoming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank ,  almost a cliffat its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds ;  and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steepa golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land betweenin the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water ,  bordered with ancient willows ,  arched over with willows ,  blocked with fallen willows ,  and flecked with thousands of faded willow - leavesthe air was thick with them ,  fluttering yellow from the branches ;  for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley ,  and the reeds were rustling ,  and the willow - boughs were creakingthis is the river withywindlei will go on and exploreafter a while he reappeared ,  and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff - foot and the river ;  in some places firm turf went down to the water ' s edgeif we turn left and follow it ,  we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest eventuallywho made the track ,  do you suppose ,  and whyi am sure it was not for our benefiti am getting very suspicious of this forest and everything in it ,  and i begin to believe all the stories about itand have you any idea how far eastward we should have to goi don ' t know in the least how far down the withywindle we are ,  or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along itbut there is no other way out that i can see or think ofeverywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall ,  in places far above their heads ;  but once found ,  the path was easy to follow ,  as it turned and twisted ,  picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and poolshere and there it passed over other rills ,  running down gullies into the withywindle out of the higher forest - lands ,  and at these points there were tree - trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully acrossthe hobbits began to feel very hotthere were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their ears ,  and the afternoon sun was burning on their backsat last they came suddenly into a thin shade ;  great grey branches reached across the patheach step forward became more reluctant than the lastsleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs ,  and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyesfrodo felt his chin go down and his head nodjust in front of him pippin fell forward on to his kneesfrodo haltedmust have napit ' s cool under the willowswe must get clear of the forest firstbeside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidlysuddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming himhis head swamthere now seemed hardly a sound in the airthe flies had stopped buzzingonly a gentle noise on the edge of hearing ,  a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered ,  seemed to stir in the boughs abovehe lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow - tree ,  old and hoaryenormous it looked ,  its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long - fingered hands ,  its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs movedthe leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him ,  and he toppled over ,  lying where he fell upon the grassmerry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willow - trunkbehind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creakedthey looked up at the grey and yellow leaves ,  moving softly against the light ,  and singingthey shut their eyes ,  and then it seemed that they could almost hear words ,  cool words ,  saying something about water and sleepthey gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willowfrodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him ;  then with an effort he struggled to his feel againhe felt a compelling desire for cool waterhe straddled one of these ,  and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water ;  and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the treesam sat down and scratched his head ,  and yawned like a cavernhe was worriedthe afternoon was getting late ,  and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncannyi don ' t trust ithark at it singing about sleep nowthis won ' t do at allhe found that two had wandered on a good way along the path ;  and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others ,  when he heard two noises ;  one loud ,  and the other soft but very clearone was the splash of something heavy falling into the water ;  the other was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fasthe rushed back to the bankfrodo was in the water close to the edge ,  and a great tree - root seemed to be over him and holding him down ,  but he was not strugglingsam gripped him by the jacket ,  and dragged him from under the root ;  and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bankalmost at once he woke ,  and coughed and splutteredthe big root just twisted round and tipped me infrodo ,  '  said sampippin had vanishedthe crack by which he had laid himself had closed together ,  so that not a chink could be seenmerry was trapped :  another crack had closed about his waist ;  his legs lay outside ,  but the rest of him was inside a dark opening ,  the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincersfrodo and sam beat first upon the tree - trunk where pippin had lainthey then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor merryit was quite uselessi wish we were all back at crickhollowa hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches ;  the leaves rustled and whispered ,  but with a sound now of faint and far - off laughterquickly they gathered dry grass and leaves ,  and bits of bark ;  and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticksthese they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisonersas soon as sam had struck a spark into the tinder ,  it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went upthe twigs crackledlittle fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched ita tremor ran through the whole willowthe leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and angera loud scream came from merry ,  and from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yellthe branches of the willow began to sway violentlythere was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about ,  as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river - valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole forestsam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparksbut frodo ,  without any clear idea of why he did so ,  or what he hoped for ,  ran along the path crying helpit seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice :  it was blown away from him by the willow - wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves ,  as soon as the words left his mouthhe felt desperate :  lost and witlesssuddenly he sloppedthere was an answer ,  or so he thought ;  but it seemed to come from behind him ,  away down the path further back in the foresthe turned round and listened ,  and soon there could be no doubt :  someone was singing a song ;  a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily ,  but it was singing nonsense :           hey dolring a dong dilloring a dongfal lal the willowtom bom ,  jolly tom ,  tom bombadillohalf hopeful and half afraid of some new danger ,  frodo and sam now both stood stillsuddenly out of a long string of nonsense - words  ( or so they seemed )  the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song :           heycome merry dotlight goes the weather - wind and the feathered starlingdown along under hill ,  shining in the sunlight ,            waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight ,            there my pretty lady isriver - woman ' s daughter ,            slender as the

hear me singingfrodo and sam stood as if enchantedthe wind puffed outthe leaves hung silently again on stiff branchesthere was another burst of song ,  and then suddenly ,  hopping and dancing along the path ,  there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the bandwith another hop and a bound there came into view a man ,  or so it seemedat any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit ,  if not quite tall enough for one of the big people ,  though he made noise enough for one ,  slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs ,  and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drinkhe had a blue coat and a long brown beard ;  his eyes were blue and bright ,  and his face was red as a ripe apple ,  but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughterin his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water - liliessteady therewhat ' s the matter here thendo you know who i ami ' m

themthey thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the brandywine river ,  and the windows of bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lightsgreat shadows fell across them ;  trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the pathwhite mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its bordersout of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling duskit became difficult to follow the path ,  and they were very tiredtheir legs seemed leadenstrange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of them ;  and if they looked up to the pale sky ,  they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight ,  and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the woodthey began to feel that all this country was unreal ,  and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakeningjust as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill ,  they noticed that the ground was gently risingthe water began to murmurin the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam ,  where the river flowed over a short fallthen suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behindthey stepped out from the forest ,  and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before themthe river ,  now small and swift ,  was leaping merrily down to meet them ,  glinting here and there in the light of the stars ,  which were already shining in the skythe grass under their feet was smooth and short ,  as if it had been mown or shaventhe eaves of the forest behind were clipped ,  and trim as a hedgethe path was now plain before them ,  well - tended and bordered with stoneit wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll ,  now grey under the pale starry night ;  and there ,  still high above them on a further slope ,  they saw the twinkling lights of a housedown again the path went ,  and then up again ,  up a long smooth hillside of turf ,  towards the lightsuddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was openedthere was tom bombadil ' s house before them ,  up ,  down ,  under hillbehind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare ,  and beyond that the dark shapes of the barrow - downs stalked away into the eastern nightthey all hurried forward ,  hobbits and poniesalready half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from themcome merry dolrolled out the song to greet themcome derry dolhop along ,  my heartieswe are fond of partiesnow let the fun beginlet us sing togetherthen another clear voice ,  as young and as ancient as spring ,  like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills ,  came falling like silver to meet them :           now let the song beginlet us sing together           of sun ,  stars ,  moon and mist ,  rain and cloudy weather ,            light on the budding leaf ,  dew on the feather ,            wind on the open hill ,  bells on the heather ,            reeds by the shady pool ,  lilies on the water :            old tom bombadil and the river - daughterand with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold ,  and a golden light was all about themchapter 7            in the house of tom bombadil     the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold ,  and stood still ,  blinkingthey were in a long low room ,  filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof ;  and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles ,  tall and yellow ,  burning brightlyin a chair ,  at the far side of the room facing the outer door ,  sat a womanher long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders ;  her gown was green ,  green as young reeds ,  shot with silver like beads of dew ;  and her belt was of gold ,  shaped like a chain of flag - lilies set with the pale - blue eyes of forget - me - notsabout her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware ,  white water - lilies were floating ,  so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a poolthey came a few timid steps further into the room ,  and began to bow low ,  feeling strangely surprised and awkward ,  like folk that ,  knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water ,  have been answered by a fair young elf - queen clad in living flowersbut before they could say anything ,  she sprang lightly up and over the lily - bowls ,  and ran laughing towards them ;  and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a riveri am goldberry ,  daughter of the riverfear nothingfor tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadilhe stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven - voices ;  but the spell that was now laid upon him was different :  less keen and lofty was the delight ,  but deeper and nearer to mortal heart ;  marvellous and yet not strangeo slender as a willow - wando clearer than clear watero reed by

somewhere behind the house came the sound of singingevery now and again they caught ,  among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words :           old tom bombadil is a merry fellow ;            bright blue his jacket is ,  and his boots are yellowfrodo looked at her questioninglytom bombadil is the masterno one has ever caught old tom walking in the forest ,  wading in the water ,  leaping on the hill - tops under light and shadowhe has no feartom bombadil is masterhe had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaveshe laughed ,  and going to goldberry ,  took her handis the table ladeni see yellow cream and honeycomb ,  and white bread ,  and butter ;  milk ,  cheese ,  and green herbs and ripe berries gatheredis that enough for usis the supper readyyour guests are tired ,  and you had near forgottencome now ,  my merry friends ,  and tom will refresh youyou shall clean grimy hands ,  and wash your weary faces ;  cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tanglesthey came to a low room with a sloping roof  ( a penthouse ,  it seemed ,  built on to the north end of the house )its walls were of clean stone ,  but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtainsthe floor was flagged ,  and strewn with fresh green rushesthere were four deep mattresses ,  each piled with white blankets ,  laid on the floor along one sideagainst the opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins ,  and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water ,  some cold ,  some steaming hotthere were soft green slippers set ready beside each bedbefore long ,  washed and refreshed ,  the hobbits were seated at the table ,  two on each side ,  while at either end sat goldberry and the masterit was a long and merry mealthough the hobbits ate ,  as only famished hobbits can eat ,  there was no lackthe drink in their drinking - bowls seemed to be clear cold water ,  yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voicesthe guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily ,  as if it was easier and more natural than talkingat last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftlythe guests were commanded to sit quiet ,  and were set in chairs ,  each with a footstool to his tired feetthere was a fire in the wide hearth before them ,  and it was burning with a sweet smell ,  as if it were built of apple - woodwhen everything was set in order ,  all the lights in the room were put out ,  except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney - shelfthen goldberry came and stood before them ,  holding a candle ;  and she wished them each a good night and deep sleepheed no nightly noisesfor nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill - topthe sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of nighttom sat on a while beside them in silence ,  while each of them tried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at suppersleep gathered on their eyelidsat last frodo spoke :       ' did you hear me calling ,  master ,  or was it just chance that brought you at that momentnay ,  i did not hear :  i was busy singingjust chance brought me then ,  if chance you call itit was no plan of mine ,  though i was waiting for youwe heard news of you ,  and learned that you were wanderingwe guessed you ' d come ere long down to the water :  all paths lead that way ,  down to withywindleold grey willow - man ,  he ' s a mighty singer ;  and it ' s hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazesbut tom had an errand there ,  that he dared not hindereach year at summer ' s end i go to find them for her ,            in a wide pool ,  deep and clear ,  far down withywindle ;            there they open first in spring and there they linger latestby that pool long ago i found the river - daughter ,            fair young goldberry sitting in the rushessweet was her singing then ,  and her heart was beatinghe opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue :           and that proved well for you ñ for now i shall no longer           go down deep again along the forest - water ,            not while the year is oldnor shall i be passing           old man willow ' s house this side of spring - time ,            not till the merry spring ,  when the river - daughter           dances down the withy - path to bathe in the waterhe fell silent again ;  but frodo could not help asking one more question :  the one he most desired to have answeredi have never heard of him beforenot until the morningsome things are ill to hear when the world ' s in shadowsleep till the morning - light ,  rest on the pillowheed no nightly noisefear no grey willowtheir mattresses and pillows were soft as down ,  and the blankets were of white woolthey had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleepin the dead night ,  frodo lay in a dream without lightthen he saw the young moon rising ;  under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock ,  pierced by a dark arch like a great gateit seemed to frodo that he was lifted up ,  and passing over he saw that the rock - wall was a circle of hills ,  and that within it was a plain ,  and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone ,  like a vast tower but not made by handson its top stood the figure of a manthe moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred itup from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices ,  and the howling of many wolvessuddenly a shadow ,  like the shape of great wings ,  passed across the moonthe figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wieldeda mighty eagle swept down and bore him awaythe voices wailed and the wolves yammeredthere was a noise like a strong wind blowing ,  and on it was borne the sound of hoofs ,  galloping ,  galloping ,  galloping from the easthe wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone wallshe lay motionless ,  still listening ;  but all was now silent ,  and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dreamat his side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly ;  but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groanedsuddenly he woke ,  or thought he had waked ,  and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream :  tip - tap ,  squeak :  the noise was like branches fretting in the wind ,  twig - fingers scraping wall and window :  creak ,  creak ,  creakhe wondered if there were willow - trees close to the house ;  and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all ,  but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him againhe sat up ,  and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands ,  and he lay down again relievedhe seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears :   ' fear nothinghave peace until the morningheed no nightly noisesit was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet sleep :  water streaming down gently ,  and then spreading ,  spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless poolit gurgled under the walls ,  and was rising slowly but surelyit will find its way in ,  and then i shall drownthen he remembered where he was and lay down againhe seemed to hear or remember hearing :   ' nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill - tophe breathed deep and fell asleep againas far as he could remember ,  sam slept through the night in deep content ,  if logs are contentedthey woke up ,  all four at once ,  in the morning lighttom was moving about the room whistling like a starlingwhen he heard them stir he clapped his hands ,  and cried :   ' heycome merry dolmy heartiesthey leapt up refreshedfrodo ran to the eastern window ,  and found himself looking into a kitchen - garden grey with dewhe had half expected to see turf right up to the walls ,  turf all pocked with hoof - printsactually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles ;  but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunriseit was a pale morning :  in the east ,  behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges ,  lay glimmering deeps of yellowthe sky spoke of rain to come ;  but the light was broadening quickly ,  and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leavespippin looked out of the western window ,  down into a pool of mistthe forest was hidden under a fogit was like looking down on to a sloping cloud - roof from abovethere was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows ;  the valley of the withywindlethe stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadowsnear at hand was a flower - garden and a clipped hedge silver - netted ,  and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew - dropsthere

outsidethe room looked westward over the mist - clouded valley ,  and the window was openwater dripped down from the thatched eaves abovebefore they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof ,  and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily downbehind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiledas they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky ,  the clear voice of goldberry singing up above themthey could hear few words ,  but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain - song ,  as sweet as showers on dry hills ,  that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the sea far belowthe hobbits listened with delight ;  and frodo was glad in his heart ,  and blessed the kindly weather ,  because it delayed them from departingthe thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke ;  but he guessed now that they would not go further that daythe upper wind settled in the west and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the downsnothing could be seen all round the house but falling waterfrodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valleytom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house ,  waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain ñ and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry ,  except for his bootsthese he took off and put in the chimney - cornerthen he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round himtoo wet for hobbit - folk ñ let them rest while they are ableit ' s a good day for long tales ,  for questions and for answers ,  so tom will start the talkingoften his voice would turn to song ,  and he would get out of his chair and dance abouthe told them tales of bees and flowers ,  the ways of trees ,  and the strange creatures of the forest ,  about the evil things and good things ,  things friendly and things unfriendly ,  cruel things and kind things ,  and secrets hidden under bramblesas they listened ,  they began to understand the lives of the forest ,  apart from themselves ,  indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at homemoving constantly in and out of his talk was old man willow ,  and frodo learned now enough to content him ,  indeed more than enough ,  for it was not comfortable loretom ' s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts ,  which were often dark and strange ,  and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth ,  gnawing ,  biting ,  breaking ,  hacking ,  burning :  destroyers and usurpersit was not called the old forest without reason ,  for it was indeed ancient ,  a survivor of vast forgotten woods ;  and in it there lived yet ,  ageing no quicker than the hills ,  the fathers of the fathers of trees ,  remembering times when they were lordsthe countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom ,  and with malicebut none were more dangerous than the great willow :  his heart was rotten ,  but his strength was green ;  and he was cunning ,  and a master of winds ,  and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the riverhis grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root - threads in the ground ,  and invisible twig - fingers in the air ,  till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downssuddenly tom ' s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream ,  over bubbling waterfalls ,  over pebbles and worn rocks ,  and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies ,  wandering at last up on to the downsthey heard of the great barrows ,  and the green mounds ,  and the stone - rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hillssheep were bleating in flocksgreen walls and white walls rosethere were fortresses on the heightskings of little kingdoms fought together ,  and the young sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swordsthere was victory and defeat ;  and towers fell ,  fortresses were burned ,  and flames went up into the skygold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens ;  and mounds covered them ,  and the stone doors were shut ;  and the grass grew over allsheep walked for a while biting the grass ,  but soon the hills were empty againa shadow came out of dark places far away ,  and the bones were stirred in the moundsbarrow - wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers ,  and gold chains in the windthe hobbits shudderedeven in the shire the rumour of the barrow - wights of the barrow - downs beyond the forest had been heardbut it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to ,  even by a comfortable fireside far awaythese four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds :  the house of tom bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hillsthey lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily ,  looking aside at one anotherwhen they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought ,  into limes when the world was wider ,  and the seas flowed straight to the western shore ;  and still on and back tom went singing out into ancient starlight ,  when only the elf - sires were awakethen suddenly he slopped ,  and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleepthe hobbits sat still before him ,  enchanted ;  and it seemed as if ,  under the spell of his words ,  the wind had gone ,  and the clouds had dried up ,  and the day had been withdrawn ,  and darkness had come from east and west ,  and all the sky was filled with the light of white starswhether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed frodo could not tellhe did not feel either hungry or tired ,  only filled with wonderthe stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round himhe spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence :       ' who are you ,  masterthat ' s the only answertell me ,  who are you ,  alone ,  yourself and namelessbut you are young and i am oldeldest ,  that ' s what i ammark my words ,  my friends :  tom was here before the river and the trees ;  tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acornhe made paths before the big people ,  and saw the little people arrivinghe was here before the kings and the graves and the barrow - wightswhen the elves passed westward ,  tom was here already ,  before the seas were benthe knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless ñ before the dark lord came from outsidewhen they turned again ,  goldberry stood in the door behind ,  framed in lightshe held a candle ,  shielding its flame from the draught with her hand ;  and the light flowed through it ,  like sunlight through a white shelllet us now laugh and be gladand long listening ' s hungry work ,  morning ,  noon ,  and eveningsuddenly he hopped through the door and disappearedquickly he returned ,  bearing a large and laden traythen tom and goldberry set the table ;  and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter :  so fair was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of tomyet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance ,  neither hindering the other ,  in and out of the room ,  and round about the table ;  and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in orderthe boards blazed with candles ,  white and yellowtom bowed to his guestsbut tom was all in clean blue ,  blue as rain - washed forget - me - nots ,  and he had green stockingsit was a supper even better than beforethe hobbits under the spell of tom ' s words may have missed one meal or many ,  but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eatenthey did not sing or even speak much for a while ,  and paid close attention to businessbut after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again ,  and their voices rang out in mirth and laughterafter they had eaten ,  goldberry sang many songs for them ,  songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence ;  and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known ,  and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depthsthen once more she wished them each good night and left them by the firesidebut tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questionshe appeared already to know much about them and all their families ,  and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselvesit no longer surprised them ;  but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot ,  whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imaginedit was also clear that tom had dealings with the elves ,  and it seemed that in some fashion ,  news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodoindeed so much did tom know ,  and so cunning was his questioning ,  that frodo found himself telling him more about bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to gandalftom wagged his head up and down ,  and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the ridersit seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown - skinned handthen suddenly he put it to his eye and laughedfor a second the hobbits had a vision ,  both comical and alarming ,  of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of goldthen tom put the ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelightfor a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about thisthen they gaspedthere was no sign of tom disappearingtom laughed again ,  and then he spun the ring in the air ñ and it vanished with a flashfrodo gave a cry ñ and tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smilefrodo looked at it closely ,  and rather suspiciously  ( like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler )it was the same ring ,  or looked the same and weighed the same :  for that ring had always seemed to frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the handbut something prompted him to make surehe was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming to make so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously importanthe waited for an opportunity ,  when the talk was going again ,  and tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways ñ then he slipped the ring onmerry turned towards him to say something and gave a start ,  and checked an exclamationfrodo was delighted  ( in a way )  :  it was his own ring all right ,  for merry was staring blankly at his chair ,  and obviously could not see himhe got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer doorcome frodo ,  therewhere be you a - goingold tom bombadil ' s not as blind as that yettake off your golden ringyour hand ' s more fair without itleave your game and sit down beside mewe must talk a while more ,  and think about the morningtom must teach the right road ,  and keep your feet from wanderingtom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow ,  and it would be a glad morning ,  and setting out would be hopefulbut they would do well to start early ;  for weather in that country was a thing that even tom could not be sure of for long ,  and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jackethe told them not to be afraid ñ but to mind their own businessdon ' t you go a - meddling with old stone or cold wights or prying in their houses ,

altogether after him ,  he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh ,  and taking candles led them back to their bedroomchapter 8            fog on the barrow - downs     that night they heard no noisesbut either in his dreams or out of them ,  he could not tell which ,  frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind ;  a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain - curtain ,  and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver ,  until at last it was rolled back ,  and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrisethe vision melted into waking ;  and there was tom whistling like a tree - full of birds ;  and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open windowoutside everything was green and pale goldafter breakfast ,  which they again ate alone ,  they made ready to say farewell ,  as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning :  cool ,  bright ,  and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin bluethe air came fresh from the north - westtheir quiet ponies were almost frisky ,  sniffing and moving restlesslytom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep ,  bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speedthey rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house ,  and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill - brow under which it shelteredthey had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope ,  when suddenly frodo stoppedwe have never said farewell to her ,  nor seen her since the eveningthere on the hill - brow she stood beckoning to them :  her hair was flying loose ,  and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmereda light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she dancedthey hastened up the last slope ,  and stood breathless beside herthey bowed ,  but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round ;  and they looked out from the hill - top over lands under the morningit was now as clear and far - seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the forest ,  which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the westin that direction the land rose in wooded ridges ,  green ,  yellow ,  russet under the sun ,  beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywineto the south ,  over the line of the withywindle ,  there was a distant glint like pale glass where the brandywine river made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbitsnorthward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth - colours ,  until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distanceeastward the barrow - downs rose ,  ridge behind ridge into the morning ,  and vanished out of eyesight into a guess :  it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky ,  but it spoke to them ,  out of memory and old tales ,  of the high and distant mountainsthey took a deep draught of the air ,  and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wishedit seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the road ,  when they should be leaping ,  as lusty as tom ,  over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the mountainsgoldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughtsnorth with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footstepsmake haste while the sun shineshe bowed low ,  and mounted his pony ,  and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hilltom bombadil ' s house and the valley ,  and the forest were lost to viewthe air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside ,  and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathedturning back ,  when they reached the bottom of the green hollow ,  they saw goldberry ,  now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky :  she was standing still watching them ,  and her hands were stretched out towards themas they looked she gave a clear call ,  and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hilltheir way wound along the floor of the hollow ,  and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley ,  and then over the shoulder of further hills ,  and down their long limbs ,  and up their smooth sides again ,  up on to new hill - tops and down into new valleysthere was no tree nor any visible water :  it was a country of grass and short springy turf ,  silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land ,  and high lonely cries of strange birdsas they journeyed the sun mounted ,  and grew hoteach time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown lesswhen they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant forest seemed to be smoking ,  as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and moulda shadow now lay round the edge of sight ,  a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap ,  hot and heavyabout mid - day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened ,  like a shallow saucer with a green mounded riminside there was no air stirring ,  and the sky seemed near their headsthey rode across and looked northwardsthen their hearts rose ,  for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expectedcertainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive ,  but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an enda long valley lay below them winding away northwards ,  until it came to an opening between two steep shouldersbeyond ,  there seemed to be no more hillsdue north they faintly glimpsed a long dark linethat is a line of trees ,  '  said merry ,   ' and that must mark the roadall along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are trees growingsome say they were planted in the old daysthat view was somehow disquieting ;  so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circlein the midst of it there stood a single stone ,  standing tall under the sun above ,  and at this hour casting no shadowit was shapeless and yet significant :  like a landmark ,  or a guarding finger ,  or more like a warningbut they were now hungry ,  and the sun was still at the fearless noon ;  so they set their backs against the east side of the stoneit was cool ,  as if the sun had had no power to warm it ;  but at that time this seemed pleasantthere they took food and drink ,  and made as good a noon - meal under the open sky as anyone could wish ;  for the food came from  ' down under hill 'tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the daytheir ponies unburdened strayed upon the grassriding over the hills ,  and eating their fill ,  the warm sun and the scent of turf ,  lying a little too long ,  stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses :  these things are ,  perhaps ,  enough to explain what happenedhowever ,  that may be :  they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to takethe standing stone was cold ,  and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over themthe sun ,  a pale and watery yellow ,  was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay ;  north ,  south ,  and east ,  beyond the wall the fog was thick ,  cold and whitethe air was silent ,  heavy and chilltheir ponies were standing crowded together with their heads downthe hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm ,  and ran to the western rimthey found that they were upon an island in the fogeven as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun ,  it sank before their eyes into a white sea ,  and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behindthe fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them ,  and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof :  they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stonethey felt as if a trap was closing about them ;  but they did not quite lose heartthey still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road ahead ,  and they still knew in which direction it layin any case ,  they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their mindsthey packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would worksoon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill ,  down into a foggy seaas they went down the mist became colder and damper ,  and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheadswhen they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods ,  which soon became bedewed with grey dropsthen ,  mounting their ponies ,  they went slowly on again ,  feeling their way by the rise and fall of the groundthey were steering ,  as well as they could guess ,  for the gate - like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morningonce they were through the gap ,  they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the roadtheir thoughts did not go beyond that ,  except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fogtheir going was very slowto prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file ,  with frodo leadingsam was behind him ,  and after him came pippin ,  and then merrythe valley seemed to stretch on endlesslysuddenly frodo saw a hopeful signon either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist ;  and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills ,  the north - gate of the barrow - downsif they could pass that ,  they would be freebut his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarmthe dark patches grew darker ,  but they shrank ;  and suddenly he saw ,  towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door ,  two huge standing stoneshe could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley ,  when he looked out from the hill in the morninghe had passed between them almost before he was aware :  and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round himhis pony reared and snorted ,  and he fell offwhen he looked back he found that he was alone :  the others had not followed himwhy don ' t you keep upfear took him ,  and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly :   ' samfrom some way off ,  or so it seemed ,  he thought he heard a cry :   ' hoyhe plunged off in the direction of the call ,  and found himself going steeply uphillas he struggled on he called again ,  and kept on calling more and more frantically ;  but he heard no answer for some time ,  and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above himoften repeated ,  ending with a last helpthat trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut shorthe stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries ;  but the light was now gone ,  and clinging night had closed about him ,  so that it was impossible to be sure of any directionhe seemed all the time to be climbing up and uponly the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hillhe was weary ,  sweating and yet chilledit was wholly darkthere was no replyhe stood listeninghe was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold ,  and that up here a wind was beginning to blow ,  an icy winda change was coming in the weatherthe mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tattershis breath was smoking ,  and the darkness was less near and thickhe looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fogthe wind began to hiss over the grasshe imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry ,  and he made towards it ;  and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside ,  and the starry sky was unveileda glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill - top ,  which he must have climbed from the northout of the east the biting wind was blowingto his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shapea great barrow stood therehis knees gave ,  and he fell on the groundnothing happened ,  and there was no soundtrembling he looked up ,  in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the starsit leaned over himhe thought there were two eyes ,  very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distancethen a grip stronger and colder than iron seized himthe icy touch froze his bones ,  and he remembered no morewhen he came to himself again ,  for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dreadthen suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned ,  caught hopelessly ;  he was in a barrowa barrow - wight had taken him ,  and he was probably already under the dreadful spells of the barrow - wights about which whispered tales spokehe dared not move ,  but lay as he found himself :  flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breastbut though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him ,  he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo baggins and his stories ,  of their jogging along together in the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventuresthere is a seed of courage hidden  ( often deeply ,  it is true )  in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit ,  wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it growfrodo was neither very fat nor very timid ;  indeed ,  though he did not know it ,  bilbo  ( and gandalf )  had thought him the best hobbit in the shirehe thought he had come to the end of his adventure ,  and a terrible end ,  but the thought hardened himhe found himself stiffening ,  as if for a final spring ;  he no longer felt limp like a helpless preyas he lay there ,  thinking and getting a hold of himself ,  he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way :  a pale greenish light was growing round himit did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in ,  for the light seemed to be coming out of himself ,  and from the floor beside him ,  and had not yet reached the roof or wallhe turned ,  and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam ,  pippin ,  and merrythey were on their backs ,  and their faces looked deathly pale ;  and they were clad in whiteabout them lay many treasures ,  of gold maybe ,  though in that light they looked cold and unlovelyon their heads were circlets ,  gold chains were about their waists ,  and on their fingers were many ringsswords lay by their sides ,  and shields were at their feetbut across their three necks lay one long naked swordsuddenly a song began :  a cold murmur ,  rising and fallingthe voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary ,  sometimes high in the air and thin ,  sometimes like a low moan from the groundout of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds ,  strings of words would now and again shape themselves :  grim ,  hard ,  cold words ,  heartless and miserablethe night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved ,  and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungeredfrodo was chilled to the marrowafter a while the song became clearer ,  and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation :           cold be hand and heart and bone ,            and cold be sleep under stone :            never mare to wake on stony bed ,            never ,  till the sun fails and the moon is deadin the black wind the stars shall die ,            and still on gold here let them lie ,            till the dark lord lifts his hand           over dead sea and withered landhe heard behind his head a creaking and scraping soundraising himself on one arm he looked ,  and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a cornerround the corner a long arm was groping ,  walking on its fingers towards sam ,  who was lying nearest ,  and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon himat first frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantationthen a wild thought of escape came to himhe wondered if he put on the ring ,  whether the barrow - wight would miss him ,  and he might find some way outhe thought of himself running free over the grass ,  grieving for merry ,  and sam ,  and pippin ,  but free and alive himselfgandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could dobut the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong :  he could not leave his friends so easilyhe wavered ,  groping in his pocket ,  and then fought with himself again ;  and as he did so the arm crept nearersuddenly resolve hardened in him ,  and he seized a short sword that lay beside him ,  and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companionswith what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist ,  and the hand broke off ;  but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hiltthere was a shriek and the light vanishedin the dark there was a snarling noisefrodo fell forward over merry ,  and merry ' s face felt coldall at once back into his mind ,  from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog ,  came the memory of the house down under the hill ,  and of tom singinghe remembered the rhyme that tom had taught themin a small desperate voice he began :  hotom bombadiland with that name his voice seemed to grow strong :  it had a full and lively sound ,  and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpettom bombadil ,  tom bombadilloby water ,  wood and hill ,  by the reed and willow ,            by fire ,  sun and moon ,  harken now and hear uscome ,  tom bombadil ,  for our need is near usthere was a sudden deep silence ,  in which frodo could hear his heart beatingafter a long slow moment he heard plain ,  but far away ,  as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls ,  an answering voice singing :           old tom bombadil is a merry fellow ,            bright blue his jacket is ,  and his boots are yellownone has ever caught him yet ,  for tom ,  he is the master :            his songs are stronger songs ,  and his feet are fasterthere was a loud rumbling sound ,  as of stones rolling and falling ,  and suddenly light streamed in ,  real light ,  the plain light of daya low door - like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond frodo ' s feet ;  and there was tom ' s head  ( hat ,  feather ,  and all )  framed against the light of the sun rising red behind himthe light fell upon the floor ,  and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside frodothey did not stir ,  but the sickly hue had left themthey looked now as if they were only very deeply asleeptom stooped ,  removed his hat ,  and came into the dark chamber ,  singing :           get out ,  you old wightvanish in the sunlightshrivel like the cold mist ,  like the winds go wailing ,            out into the barren lands far beyond the mountainscome never here againleave your barrow emptylost and forgotten be ,  darker than the darkness ,            where gates stand for ever shut ,  till the world is mendedat these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crashthen there was a long trailing shriek ,  fading away into an unguessable distance ;  and after that silenceyou must help me bear themas frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still ,  like a wounded spider ,  in a heap of fallen earthtom went back in again ,  and there was a sound of much thumping and stampingwhen he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure :  things of gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  and bronze ;  many beads and chains and jewelled ornamentshe climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshinethere he stood ,  with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair ,  and looked down upon the three hobbits ,  that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the moundraising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice :           wake now my merry tadswake and hear me callingwarm now be heart and limbthe cold stone is fallen ;            dark door is standing wide ;  dead hand is brokennight under night is flown ,  and the gate is opento frodo ' s great joy the hobbits stirred ,  stretched their arms ,  rubbed their eyes ,  and then suddenly sprang upthey looked about in amazement ,  first at frodo ,  and then at tom standing large as life on the barrow - top above them ;  and then at themselves in their thin white rags ,  crowned and belted with pale gold ,  and jingling with trinketsthen he stopped ,  and a shadow came over his face ,  and he closed his eyesthe spear in my hearti have been dreamingwhere did you get to ,  frodolet us think of what we are to do nowlet us go onone would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened ;  and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him ,  and saw the merry glint in his eyesclothes are but little loss ,  if you escape from drowningbe glad ,  my merry friends ,  and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limbcast off these cold ragsrun naked on the grass ,  while tom goes a - huntinglooking down after him frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next ,  still whistling and crying :           heycome hoy nowwhither do you wanderup ,  down ,  near or far ,  here ,  there or yondersharp - ears ,  wise - nose ,  swish - tail and bumpkin ,            white - socks my little lad ,  and old fatty lumpkinso he sang ,  running fast ,  tossing up his hat and catching it ,  until he was hidden by a fold of the ground :  but for some time his hey nowcame floating back down the wind ,  which had shifted round towards the souththe air was growing very warm againthe hobbits ran about for a while on the grass ,  as he told themthen they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime ,  or of people that ,  after being long ill and bedridden ,  wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promiseby the time that tom returned they were feeling strong  ( and hungry )he reappeared ,  hat first ,  over the brow of the hill ,  and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies :  their own five and one morethe last was plainly old fatty lumpkin :  he was larger ,  stronger ,  fatter  ( and older )  than their own poniesmerry ,  to whom the others belonged ,  had not ,  in fact ,  given them any such names ,  but they answered to the new names that tom had given them for the rest of their livestom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a linethen tom bowed to the hobbitsfor they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into ;  and if they run to save themselves ,  then they run the right wayyou must forgive them all ;  for though their hearts are faithful ,  to face fear of barrow - wights is not what they were made forsee ,  here they come again ,  bringing all their burdenswhen your ponies stayed with me ,  they got to know my lumpkin ;  and they smelt him in the night ,  and quickly ran to meet himi thought he ' d look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear awaybut now ,  my jolly lumpkin ,  old tom ' s going to ridehe ' s coming with you ,  just to set you on the road ;  so he needs a ponyfor you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding ,  when you ' re on your own legs trying to trot beside themtom can ' t be always near to open doors and willow - crackstom has his house to mind ,  and goldberry is waitingtheir last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day beforethey breakfasted now off the remainder of tom ' s provisions ,  meant for their supper ,  with additions that tom had brought with himit was not a large meal  ( considering hobbits and the circumstances )  ,  but they felt much better for itwhile they were eating tom went up to the mound ,  and looked through the treasuresmost of these he made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grasshe bade them lie there  ' free to all finders ,  birds ,  beastselves or men ,  and all kindly creatures '  ;  for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no wight ever come back to ithe chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones ,  many - shaded like flax - flowers or the wings of blue butterflieshe looked long at it ,  as if stirred by some memory ,  shaking his head ,  and saying at last :       ' here is a pretty toy for tom and for his ladyfair was she who long ago wore this on her shouldergoldberry shall wear it now ,  and we will not forget herthey gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths ,  wrought of some strange metal ,  light and strong ,  and set with many fiery stoneswhether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound ,  the blades seemed untouched by time ,  unrusted ,  sharp ,  glittering in the sunthen the vision faded ,  and they were back in the sunlit worldit was time to start againthey made ready ,  packing their bags and lading their poniestheir new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets ,  feeling them very awkward ,  and wondering if they would be of any usefighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land themat last they set offthey led their ponies down the hill ;  and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valleythey looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill ,  and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flamethen they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from viewthough frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate ,  and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through ,  and the land fell away before themit was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily beside them ,  or before them ,  on fatty lumpkin ,  who could move much faster than his girth promisedtom sang most of the time ,  but it was chiefly nonsense ,  or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits ,  an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delightthey went forward steadily ,  but they soon saw that the road was further away than they had imaginedeven without a fog ,  their sleep at mid - day would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day beforethe dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further sidetom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom ,  but a very long lime agohe seemed to remember something sad about it ,  and would not say muchthey climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall ,  and then tom turned due north ,  for they had been bearing somewhat to the westthe land was now open and fairly level ,  and they quickened their pace ,  but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead ,  and they knew that they had come back to the road after many unexpected adventuresthey galloped their ponies over the last furlongs ,  and halted under the long shadows of the treesthey were on the top of a sloping bank ,  and the road ,  now dim as evening drew on ,  wound away below themat this point it ran nearly from south - west to north - east ,  and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollowit was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain ;  there were pools and pot - holes full of waterthey rode down the bank and looked up and downthere was nothing to be seenbut perhaps the delay will prove useful ñ it may have put them off our trailthe shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly over them againever since they had entered the forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the road ;  only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them ,  and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the road itselfthey looked anxiously back towards the setting sun ,  but the road was brown and emptybut do not trust my guess ;  for i cannot tell for certainout east my knowledge failstom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his countrythey felt that he would know how to deal with black riders ,  if anyone didthey would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them ,  and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the shire ,  and in the gathering twilight they longed for homea deep loneliness and sense of loss was on themthey stood silent ,  reluctant to make the final parting ,  and only slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell ,  and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without haltingthere you ' ll find an old inn that is called the prancing ponybarliman butterbur is the worthy keeperthere you can stay the night ,  and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your waybe bold ,  but warykeep up your merry hearts ,  and ride to meet your fortunetom has his house to mind ,  and goldberry is waitingthen he turned ,  tossed up his hat ,  leaped on lumpkin ' s back ,  and rode up over the bank and away singing into the duskthe hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was

until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance aheadbefore them rose bree - hill barring the way ,  a dark mass against misty stars ;  and under its western flank nestled a large villagetowards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire ,  and a door between them and the nightchapter 9            at the sign of the prancing pony     bree was the chief village of the bree - land ,  a small inhabited region ,  like an island in the empty lands round aboutbesides bree itself ,  there was staddle on the other side of the hill ,  combe in a deep valley a little further eastward ,  and archet on the edge of the chetwoodlying round bree - hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broadthe men of bree were brown - haired ,  broad ,  and rather short ,  cheerful and independent :  they belonged to nobody but themselves ;  but they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits ,  dwarves ,  elves ,  and other inhabitants of the world about them than was  ( or is )  usual with big peopleaccording to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the middle - worldfew had survived the turmoils of the elder days ;  but when the kings returned again over the great sea they had found the bree - men still there ,  and they were still there now ,  when the memory of the old kings had faded into the grassin those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west ,  or within a hundred leagues of the shirebut in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderersthe bree - folk called them rangers ,  and knew nothing of their originthey were taller and darker than the men of bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing ,  and to understand the languages of beasts and birdsthey roamed at will southwards ,  and eastwards even as far as the misty mountains ;  but they were now few and rarely seenwhen they appeared they brought news from afar ,  and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to ;  but the bree - folk did not make friends of themthere were also many families of hobbits in the bree - land and theyclaimed to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in the world ,  one that was founded long before even the brandywine was crossed and the shire colonizedthey lived mostly in staddle though there were some in bree itself ,  especially on the higher slopes of the hill ,  above the houses of the menthe big folk and the little folk  ( as they called one another )  were on friendly terms ,  minding their own affairs in their own ways ,  but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the bree - folknowhere else in the world was this peculiar  ( but excellent )  arrangement to be foundthe bree - folk ,  big and little ,  did not themselves travel much ;  and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concernoccasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland ,  or the eastfarthing ;  but though their link land was not much further than a day ' s riding east of the brandywine bridge ,  the hobbits of the shire now seldom visited itan occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to the inn for a night or two ,  but even that was becoming less and less usualthe shire - hobbits referred to those of bree ,  and to any others that lived beyond the borders ,  as outsiders ,  and took very little interest in them ,  considering them dull and uncouththere were probably many more outsiders scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imaginedsome ,  doubtless ,  were no better than tramps ,  ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited thembut in the bree - land ,  at any rate ,  the hobbits were decent and prosperous ,  and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives insideit was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the shire and breethere was bree - blood in the brandybucks by all accountsthe village of bree had some hundred stone houses of the big folk ,  mostly above the road ,  nestling on the hillside with windows looking weston that side ,  running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it ,  there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner sideover this the road crossed by a causeway ;  but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gatethere was another gate in the southern comer where the road ran out of the villagethe gates were closed at nightfall ;  but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepersdown on the road ,  where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill ,  there was a large innit had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greaterfor bree stood at an old meeting of ways ;  another ancient road crossed the east road just outside  ( he dike at the western end of the village ,  and in former days men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on itstrange as news from bree was still a saying in the eastfarthing ,  descending from those days ,  when news from north ,  south ,  and east could be heard in the inn ,  and when the shire - hobbits used to go more often to hear itbut the northern lands had long been desolate ,  and the north road was now seldom used :  it was grass - grown ,  and the bree - folk called it the greenwaythe inn of bree was still there ,  however ,  and the innkeeper was an important personhis house was a meeting place for the idle ,  talkative ,  and inquisitive among the inhabitants ,  large and small ,  of the four villages ;  and a resort of rangers and other wanderers ,  and for such travellers  ( mostly dwarves )  as still journeyed on the east road ,  to and from the mountainsit was dark ,  and white stars were shining ,  when frodo and his companions came at last to the greenway - crossing and drew near the villagethey came to the west - gate and found it shut ,  but at the door of the lodge beyond it ,  there was a man sittinghe jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprisefour hobbitsand what ' s more ,  out of the shire by their talk ,  '  said the gatekeeper ,  softly as if speaking to himselfhe stared at them darkly for a moment ,  and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride throughwhat may your names be ,  might i askis that enough for youthe bree - folk used to be fair - spoken to travellers ,  or so i had heardbut you ' ll find maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you questionsthere ' s queer folk aboutif you go on to the pony ,  you ' ll find you ' re oat the only guestshe was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them ,  as they rode forwardhe wondered why the man was so suspicious ,  and whether any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbitscould it have been gandalfhe might have arrived ,  while they were delayed in the forest and the downsbut there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasythe man stared after the hobbits for a moment ,  and then he went back to his houseas soon as his back was turned ,  a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village streetthe hobbits rode on up a gentle slope ,  passing a few detached houses ,  and drew up outside the innthe houses looked large and strange to themsam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows ,  and felt his heart sinkhe had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees ,  and other creatures even more terrifying ,  some time or other in the course of his journey ;  but at the moment he was finding his first sight of men and their tall houses quite enough ,  indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring dayhe pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn - yard ,  and black riders peering out of dark upper windowsit would be more homelikei expect it ' s homelike enough insideit had a front on the road ,  and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill ,  so that at the rear the second - floor windows were level with the groundthere was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings ,  and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad stepsthe door was open and light streamed out of itabove the arch there was a lamp ,  and beneath it swung a large signboard :  a fat white pony reared up on its hind legsover the door was painted in white letters :  the prancing pony by barliman butterburmany of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtainsas they hesitated outside in the gloom ,  someone began singing a merry song inside ,  and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorusthey listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their poniesthe song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clappingthey led their ponies under the arch ,  and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the stepsfrodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red facehe had a white apron on ,  and was bustling out of one door and in through another ,  carrying a tray laden with full mugsin a moment he was out again ,  wiping his hands on his apronbarliman is my namebarliman butterbur at your serviceyou ' re from the shire ,  ehmight i ask your names ,  sirtook and mrbrandybuck ,  '  said frodo ;   ' and this is sam gamgeemy name is

west come in this eveningand now there ' s youif you weren ' t hobbits ,  i doubt if we could house youbut we ' ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits ,  when this

and nob will comeif he don ' t come ,  ring and shouthe seemed capable of an endless stream of talk ,  however busy he might bethey found themselves in a small and cosy roomthere was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth ,  and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairsthere was a round table ,  already spread with a white cloth ,  and on it was a large hand - bellbut nob ,  the hobbit servant ,  came bustling in long before they thought of ringinghe brought candles and a tray full of platesbutterbur and nob came in againin a twinkling the table was laidthere was hot soup ,  cold meats ,  a blackberry tart ,  new loaves ,  slabs of butter ,  and half a ripe cheese :  good plain food ,  as good as the shire could show ,  and homelike enough to dispel the last of sam ' s misgivings  ( already much relieved by the excellence of the beer )the landlord hovered round for a link ,  and then prepared to leave themstill the company would be very pleased to welcome you ,  if you had a mindwe don ' t get outsiders ñ travellers from the shire ,  i should say ,  begging your pardon ñ often ;  and we like to hear a bit of news ,  or any story or song you may have in mindbut as you pleasering the bell ,  if you lack anythingmerry said it would be too stuffymind your ps and qs ,  and don ' t forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret ,  and are still on the high - road and not very far from the shiredon ' t get lost ,  and don ' t forget that it is safer indoorsthe gathering was large and mixed ,  as frodo discovered ,  when his eyes got used to the lightthis came chiefly from a blazing log - fire ,  for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim ,  and half veiled in smokebarliman butterbur was standing near the fire ,  talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange - looking menon the benches were various folk :  men of bree ,  a collection of local hobbits  ( sitting chattering together )  ,  a few more dwarves ,  and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and comersas soon as the shire - hobbits entered ,  there was a chorus of welcome from the bree - landersthe strangers ,  especially those that had come up the greenway ,  stared at them curiouslythe landlord introduced the newcomers to the bree - folk ,  so quickly that ,  though they caught many names ,  they were seldom sure who the names belonged tothe men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical  ( and to the shire - folk rather odd )  names ,  like rushlight ,  goatleaf ,  heathertoes ,  appledore ,  thistlewool and ferny  ( not to mention butterbur )some of the hobbits had similar namesthe mugworts ,  for instance ,  seemed numerousbut most of them had natural names ,  such as banks ,  brockhouse ,  longholes ,  sandheaver ,  and tunnelly ,  many of which were used in the shirethere were several underhills from saddle ,  and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related ,  they took frodo to their hearts as a long - lost cousinthe bree - hobbits were ,  in fact ,  friendly and inquisitive ,  and frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be givenhe gave out that he was interested in history and geography  ( at which there was much wagging of heads ,  although neither of these words were much used in the bree - dialect )he said he was thinking of writing a book  ( at which there was silent astonishment )  ,  and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the shire ,  especially in the eastern landsat this a chorus of voices broke outif frodo had really wanted to write a book ,  and had had many ears ,  he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutesand if that was not enough ,  he was given a whole list of names ,  beginning with  ' old barliman here '  ,  to whom he could go for further informationbut after a time ,  as frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on the spot ,  the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the shirefrodo did not prove very communicative ,  and he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer ,  listening and looking aroundthe men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiarthere was trouble away in the south ,  and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the move ,  looking for lands where they could find some peacethe bree - folk were sympathetic ,  but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little landone of the travellers ,  a squint - eyed ill - favoured fellow ,  was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near futurethey ' ve a right to live ,  same as other folk ,  '  he said loudlythe local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospectthe hobbits did not pay much attention to all this ,  and it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbitsbig folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit - holesthey were more interested in sam and pippin ,  who were now feeling quite at home ,  and were chatting gaily about events in the shirepippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the town hole in michel delving :  will whitfoot ,  the mayor ,  and the fattest hobbit in the westfarthing ,  had been buried in chalk ,  and came out like a floured dumplingbut there were several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasyone of the bree - landers ,  who seemed to have been in the shire several times ,  wanted to know where the underhills lived and who they were related tosuddenly frodo noticed that a strange - looking weather - beaten man ,  sitting in the shadows near the wall ,  was also listening intently to the hobbit - talkhe had a tall tankard in front of him ,  and was smoking a long - stemmed pipe curiously carvedhis legs were stretched out before him ,  showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well ,  but had seen much wear and were now caked with muda travel - stained cloak of heavy dark - green cloth was drawn close about him ,  and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face ;  but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbitshe is one of the wandering folk  - rangers we call themhe seldom talks :  not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mindhe disappears for a month ,  or a year ,  and then he pops up againhe was in and out pretty often last spring ;  but i haven ' t seen him about latelywhat his right name is i ' ve never heard :  but he ' s known round here as stridergoes about at a great pace on his long shanks ;  though he don ' t tell nobody what cause he has to hurrybut there ' s no accounting for east and west ,  as we say in bree ,  meaning the rangers and the shire - folk ,  begging your pardonfunny you should ask about himbutterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplainedfrodo found that strider was now looking at him ,  as if he had heard or guessed all that had been saidpresently ,  with a wave of his hand and a nod ,  he invited frodo to come over and sit by himas frodo drew near be threw back his hood ,  showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey ,  and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyesmaster ñ underhill ,  if old butterbur got your name righthe felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyesdrink ,  fire ,  and chance - meeting are pleasant enough ,  but ,  well ñ this isn ' t the shirethere are queer folk aboutthough i say it as shouldn ' t ,  you may think ,  '  he added with a wry smile ,  seeing frodo ' s glancefrodo returned his gaze but said nothing ;  and strider made no further signhis attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippinto his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young took ,  encouraged by his success with the fat mayor of michel delving ,  was now actually giving a comic account of bilbo ' s farewell partyhe was already giving an imitation of the speech ,  and was drawing near to the astonishing disappearancefrodo was annoyedit was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits ,  no doubt :  just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the river ;  but some  ( old butterbur ,  for instance )  knew a thing or two ,  and had probably heard rumours long ago about bilbo ' s vanishingit would bring the name of baggins to their minds ,  especially if there had been inquiries in bree after that namefrodo fidgeted ,  wondering what to dopippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting ,  and had become quite forgetful of their dangerfrodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the ring ;  and that might well be disastrousfrodo jumped up and stood on a table ,  and began to talkthe attention of pippin ' s audience was disturbedsome of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and clapped ,  thinking that mrunderhill had taken as much ale as was good for himfrodo suddenly felt very foolish ,  and found himself  ( as was his habit when making a speech )  fingering the things in his pockethe felt the ring on its chain ,  and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situationit seemed to him ,  somehow ,  as if me suggestion came to him from outside ,  from someone or something a the roomhe resisted the temptation firmly ,  and clasped the ring in his hand ,  as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischiefat any rate it gave him no inspirationhe spoke  ' a few suitable words '  ,  as they would have said in the shire :  we are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception ,  and i venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of friendship between the shire and bree ; and then he hesitated and coughedeveryone in the room was now looking at himthen in desperation he began a ridiculous song that bilbo had been rather fond of  ( and indeed rather proud of ,  for he had made up the words himself )it was about an inn ;  and that is probably why it came into frodo ' s mind just thenhere it is in fullonly a few words of it are now ,  as a rule ,  rememberedthere is an inn ,  a merry old inn            beneath an old grey hill ,            and there they brew a beer so brown           that the man in the moon himself came down            one night to drink his fillthe ostler has a tipsy cat            that plays a five - stringed fiddle ;            and up and down he runs his bow ,            now squeaking high ,  now purring low ,             now sawing in the middlethe landlord keeps a little dog            that is mighty fond of jokes ;            when there ' s good cheer among the guests ,            he cocks an ear at all the jests            and laughs until he chokesthey also keep a horned cow            as proud as any queen ;            but music turns her head like ale ,            and makes her wave her tufted tail            and dance upon the greenthe rows of silver dishes            and the store of silver spoonsfor sunday there ' s a special pair ,            and these they polish up with care            on saturday afternoonsthe man in the moon was drinking deep ,             and the cat began to wail ;            a dish and a spoon on the table danced ,            the cow in the garden madly pranced ,             and the little dog chased his tailthe man in the moon took another mug ,             and then rolled beneath his chair ;            and there he dozed and dreamed of ale ,            till in the sky the stars were pale ,             and dawn was in the airthen the ostler said to his tipsy cat :               ' the white horses of the moon ,            they neigh and champ their silver bits ;            but their master ' s been and drowned his wits ,             and the sun ' ll be rising soonthey rolled the man slowly up the hill            and bundled him into the moon ,            while his horses galloped up in rear ,            and the cow came capering like a deer ,             and a dish ran up with the spoonnow quicker the fiddle went deedle - dum - diddle ;             the dog began to roar ,            the cow and the horses stood on their heads ;            the guests all bounded from their beds            and danced upon the floorwith a ping and a pong the fiddle - strings brokethe cow jumped over the moon ,            and the little dog laughed to see such fun ,            and the saturday dish went off at a run            with the silver sunday spoonthe round moon rolled behind the hill            as the sun raised up her headshe hardly believed her fiery eyes ;            for though it was day ,  to her surprise            they all went back to bedthere was loud and long applausefrodo had a good voice ,  and the song tickled their fancybob ought to learn his cat the fiddle ,  and then we ' d have a dancecome on nowit was now frodo ' s turn to feel pleased with himselfhe capered about on the table ;  and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the moon ,  he leaped in the airmuch too vigorously ;  for he came down ,  bang ,  into a tray full of mugs ,  and slipped ,  and rolled off the table with a crash ,  clatter ,  and bumpthe audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter ,  and stopped short a gaping silence ;  for the singer disappearedhe simply vanished ,  as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a holethe local hobbits stared in amazement ,  and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barlimanall the company drew away from pippin and sam ,  who found themselves left alone in a comer ,  and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distanceit was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purposebut there was one swarthy bree - lander ,  who stood looking at them with a knowing and half - mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortablepresently he slipped out of the door ,  followed by the squint - eyed southerner :  the two had been whispering together a good deal during the eveningharry the gatekeeper also went out just behind themfrodo felt a foolnot knowing what else to do ,  he crawled away under the tables to the dark comer by strider ,  who sat unmoved ,  giving no sign of his thoughtsfrodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ringhow it came to be on his finger he could not tellhe could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang ,  and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fallfor a moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick ;  perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the roomhe did not like the looks of the men that had gone outworse than anything your friends could have saidyou have put your foot in itor should i say your fingerthen ,  if you please ,  mrbaggins ,  i should like a quiet word with youbutterbur had come trotting in ,  and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same timebutterbur ,  '  said a hobbit ;   ' or leastways i didn ' t see him ,  if you take my meaninghe just vanished into thin air ,  in a manner of speakingthere was too much of that mrunderhill to go vanishing into thin air ;  or into thick air ,  as is more likely in this roomhe ' s welcome to go where he will ,  so long as he pays in the morningthere ' s mrtook ,  now :  he ' s not vanishedi ' ve just been having a few words with strider in the comerthey were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallenmost of the hobbits and the men of bree went off then and there in a huff ,  having no fancy for further entertainment that eveningone or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselvesthe dwarves and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord ,  but not to frodo and his friendsbefore long no one was left but strider ,  who sat on ,  unnoticed ,  by the wallbutterbur did not seem much put outhe reckoned ,  very probably ,  that his house would be full again on many future nights ,  until the present mystery had been thoroughly discusseda most unfortunate accidentbut if you ' re going to do any more tumbling ,  or conjuring ,  or whatever it was ,  you ' d best warn folk beforehand ñ and warn mewe ' re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way  - uncanny ,  if you understand me ;  and we don ' t take to it all of a suddenbutterbur ,  i promise youand now i think i ' ll be getting to bedwe shall be making an early startwill you see that our ponies are ready by eight o ' clockbut before you go

suspect even old butterbur ' s fat face of concealing dark designschapter 10            strider     frodo ,  pippin ,  and sam made their way back to the parlourthere was no lightmerry was not there ,  and the fire had burned lowit was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered strider had come with themthere he was calmly sitting in a chair by the doori mean just this :  i will tell you what i know ,  and give you some good advice ñ but i shall want a rewardhe suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal ,  and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with himall of it would hardly satisfy a rogue ,  and he could not spare any of ityou have been much too careless so fari will tell you what i know ,  and leave the reward to youyou may be glad to grant it ,  when you have heard methen he shut it quietly and sat down againnow ,  i was behind the hedge this evening on the road west of bree ,  when four hobbits came out of the downlandsi need not repeat all that they said to old bombadil or to one another ,  but one thing interested meplease remember ,  said one of them ,  that the name baggins must not be mentionedunderhill ,  if any name must be giventhat interested me so much that i followed them herei slipped over the gate just behind thembaggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind ;  but if so ,  i should advise him and his friends to be more carefulstrider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping ;  but if so ,  i should advise him to explain iti wanted to find him quicklyi had learned that he was carrying out of the shire ,  well ,  a secret that concerned me and my friendsand care is neededon monday one came down the greenway ,  they say ;  and another appeared later ,  coming up the greenway from the southat last frodo spoke to pippin and sam :   ' i ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us ,  '  he saidwhy did he press us to join the companyand why on earth did we behave so foolishly :  we ought to have stayed quiet in hereonly he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sortwhen we do ,  i hope you will explain what happened at the end of your songfor that little prankñññ '       ' it was sheer accidentthat accident has made your position dangerousand more are comingthere are othersi know their numberi know these ridershe has an evil name in the bree - land ,  and queer folk call at his houseyou must have noticed him among the company :  a swarthy sneering fellowhe was very close with one of the southern strangers ,  and they slipped out together just after your  " accident "not all of those southerners mean well ;  and as for ferny ,  he would sell anything to anybody ;  or make mischief for amusementafter that they would hardly need to be told your real nameit seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is overis that enoughyou can do as you like about my reward :  take me as a guide or notbut i may say that i know all the lands between the shire and the misty mountains ,  for i have wandered over them for many yearsi am older than i looki might prove usefulyou will have to leave the open road after tonight ;  for the horsemen will watch it night and dayyou may escape from bree ,  and be allowed to go forward while the sun is up ;  but you won ' t

escape ,  if you canstrider can take you by paths that are seldom troddenwill you have himfrodo made no answer ,  his mind was confused with doubt and fearsam frowned ,  and looked at his master ;  and at last he broke out :       ' with your leave ,  mrfrodo ,  i ' d say nothis strider here ,  he warns and he says take care ;  and i say yes to that ,  and let ' s begin with himhe comes out of the wild ,  and i never heard no good of such folkhe knows something ,  that ' s plain ,  and more than i like ;  but it ' s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far

address slowly and proudly  ( he valued his reputation as a lettered man )  :             mrfrodo baggins ,  bag end ,  hobbiton in the shirethat ' s what you came to tell me ,  i suppose ,  though you ' ve taken a long time to come to the pointbutterbur looked troubledand i ' m mortal afraid of what gandalf will say ,  if harm comes of itbut i didn ' t keep it back a - purposei put it by safethen i couldn ' t find nobody willing to go to the shire next day ,  nor the day after ,  and none of my own folk were to spare ;  and then one thing after another drove it out of my mindi ' m a

another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his headhis footsteps retreated down the passageit seemed certainly to be gandalf ' sinside ,  written in the wizard ' s strong but graceful script ,  was the following message :             the prancing pony ,  breemidyear ' s day ,  shire year ,  1418dear frodo ,      bad news has reached me herei must go off at onceyou had better leave bag end

it is the real striderthere are many strange men on the roadshis true name is aragornall that is gold does not glitter ,             not all those who wander are lost ;            the old that is

to gandalfhe writes as if he was going into great dangerfrodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully ,  wondering about gandalf ' s second postscriptwould any of you have believed me till nowfor all i knew i had to persuade you to trust me without proofs ,  if i was to help youin any case ,  i did not intend to tell you all about myself at oncei had to study you first ,  and make sure of youthe enemy has set traps for me before nowas soon as i had made up my mind ,  i was ready to tell you whatever you askedbut i must admit ,  '  he added with a queer laugh ,   ' that i hoped you would take to me for my own sakea hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendshipbut there ,  i believe my looks are against meyou might be a play - acting spy ,  for all i can see ,  trying to

servants of the enemy would ,  or so i imaginei think one of his spies would ñ well ,  seem fairer and feel fouler ,  if you understandall that is gold does not glitter ,  not all those who wander are lostbut how did you know that they were in gandalf ' s letter ,  if you have never seen itstrider shall be your guidewe shall have a rough road tomorroweven if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered ,  we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticedbut i shall try to get lost as soon as possiblei know one or two ways out of bree - land other than the main roadif once we shake off the pursuit ,  i shall make for weathertopit commands a wide view all round ;  and there we shall have a chance to look about usgandalf will make for that point ,  if he follows usafter weathertop our journey will become more difficult ,  and we shall have to choose between various dangersi have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the last few years ,  when he was busy elsewherehe seldom left it unguardedwe last met on the first of may :  at sam ford down the brandywinehe told me that his business with you had gone well ,  and that you would be starting for rivendell in the last week of septemberas i knew he was at your side ,  i went away on a journey of my ownand that has proved ill ;  for plainly some news reached him ,  and i was not at hand to helpwe should have had messages ,  even if he could not come himselfwhen i returned ,  many days ago ,  i heard the ill newsthe tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seenit was the elven - folk of gildor that told me this ;  and later they told me that you had left your home ;  but there was no news of your leaving bucklandi have been watching the east road anxiouslygandalf is greater than you shire - folk know ñ as a rule you can only see his jokes and toysbut this business of ours will be his greatest taskin spite of all the danger and worry i must go to bed ,  or sleep where i sitwhere is that silly fellow ,  merryit would be the last straw ,  if we had to go out in the dark to look for himmerry came in with a rush followed by nobhe shut the door hastily ,  and leaned against ithe was out of breaththey stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped :   ' i have seen them ,  frodoi have seen themblack ridersin the villagei stayed indoors for an hourthen as you did not come back ,  i went out for a strolli had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the starssuddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near :  there was a son of deeper shade among the shadows across the road ,  just beyond the edge of the lamplightit slid away at once into the dark without a soundthere was no horsemerry started ,  noticing the stranger for the first timei will explain laterof course ,  it vanished almost at once ;  but i went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the roadi could hardly help myselfi seemed to be drawn somehowanyway ,  i went ,  and suddenly i heard voices by the hedgeone was muttering ;  and the other was whispering ,  or hissingi couldn ' t hear a word that was saidi did not creep any closer ,  because i began to tremble all overthen i felt terrified ,  and i turned back ,  and was just going to bolt home ,  when something came behind me and ii fell overbutterbur sent me out with a lanterni went down to west - gate ,  and then back up towards south - gatejust nigh bill ferny ' s house i thought i could see something in the roadi couldn ' t swear to it ,  but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something ,  lilting iti gave a shout ,  but where i got up to the spot there was no signs of them ,  and only mrbrandybuck lying by the roadsidehe seemed to be asleepvery queer he was ,  and as soon as i had roused him ,  he got up and ran back here like a harei had an ugly dream ,  which i can ' t rememberi went to piecesi don ' t know what came over methe riders must have left their horses outside ,  and passed back through the south - gate in secretthey will know all the news now ,  for they have visited bill ferny ;  and probably that southerner was a spy as wellsomething may happen in the night ,  before we leave breeand in any case that is not their wayin dark and loneliness they are strongest ;  they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people  - not until they are desperate ,  not while all the long leagues of eriador still lie before usbut their power is in terror ,  and already some in bree are in their clutchthey will drive these wretches to some evil work :  ferny ,  and some of the strangers ,  and ,  maybe ,  the gatekeeper toothey had words with harry at west - gate on mondayi was watching themhe was white and shaking when they left himthey are sure to have found out which those arethe hobbit - rooms have windows looking north and close to the groundwe will all remain together and bar this window and the doorbut first nob and i will fetch your luggagemerry was still reading and pondering gandalf ' s letter when strider and nob returnedand i made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat ,  mrbag ñ underhill ,  sir ,  '  he added with a grinpippin laughedtheir bags and gear they piled on the parlour - floorthey pushed a low chair against

they all fell silent ,  and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleepchapter 11            a knife in the dark     as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree ,  darkness lay on buckland ;  a mist

was unable to rest or go to bed :  there was a brooding threat in the breathless night - airas he stared out into the gloom ,  a black shadow moved under the trees ;  the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a soundterror seized himhe shrank back ,  and for a moment he stood trembling in the hallthen he shut and locked the doorthe night deepenedthere came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the laneoutside the gate they stopped ,  and three black figures entered ,  like shades of night creeping across the groundone went to the door ,  one to the corner of the house on either side ;  and there they stood ,  as still as the shadows of stones ,  while night went slowly onthe house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlesslythere was a faint stir in the leaves ,  and a cock crowed far awaythe cold hour before dawn was passingthe figure by the door movedin the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed ,  as if a chill light had been unsheathedthere was a blow ,  soft but heavy ,  and the door shudderedat a second blow the door yielded and fell back ,  with timbers burst and lock brokenthe black figures passed swiftly inat that

doorstepi haven ' t got itat last they got the idea that enemies were in buckland ,  some strange invasion from the old forestand then they lost no more timethe brandybucks were blowing the horn -

people blowsauron would deal with them latermeanwhile they had another errand :  they knew now that the house was empty and the ring had gonethey rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shirein the early night frodo woke from deep sleep ,  suddenly ,  as if some sound or presence had disturbed himhe saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair :  his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire ,  which had been tended and was burning brightly ;  but he made no sign or movementfrodo soon went to sleep again ;  but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofsthe wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it ;  and far off he heard a horn blowing wildlyhe opened his eyes ,  and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn - yardstrider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clangthe first grey light of day was in the room ,  and a cold air was coming through the open windowas soon as strider had roused them all ,  he led the way to their bedroomswhen they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice :  the windows had been forced open and were swinging ,  and the curtains were flapping ;  the beds were tossed about ,  and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor ;  the brown mat was torn to piecesstrider immediately went to fetch the landlordbutterbur looked sleepy and frightenedhe had hardly closed his eyes all night  ( so he said )  ,  but he had never heard a soundwhat are we coming towe will leave at oncenever mind about breakfast :  a drink and a bite standing will have to dowe shall be packed in a few minutesbutterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready ,  and to fetch them a  ' bite 'but very soon he came back in dismaythe ponies had vanishedthe stable - doors had all been opened in the night ,  and they were gone :  not only merry ' s ponies ,  but every other horse and beast in the placefrodo was crushed by the newshow could they hope to reach rivendell on foot ,  pursued by mounted enemiesthey might as well set out for the moonstrider sat silent for a while ,  looking at the hobbits ,  as if he was weighing up their strength and couragei was going to walk in any caseit is the food and stores that trouble mewe cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and rivendell ,  except what we take with us ;  and we ought to take plenty to spare ;  for we may be delayed ,  or forced to go round - about ,  far out of the direct wayhow much are you prepared to carry on your backsi don ' t suppose we could hire them ,  but we might be able to buy them ,  '  he added ,  doubtfully ,  wondering if he could afford itas for other animals ,  horses or ponies for draught or what not ,  there are very few of them in bree ,  and they won ' t be for salebut i ' ll do what i cani ' ll rout out bob and send him round as soon as may bei am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at leastbut so ends all hope of starting early ,  and slipping away quietlywe might as well have blown a horn to announce our departurethat was part of their plan ,  no doubtlet ' s get hold of nobbob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood ñ except one :  bill ferny had one that he might possibly sellwouldn ' t the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff ,  or help in tracking us ,  or somethingi fancy this is only an afterthought of kind master ferny ' s :  just a way of increasing his profits from the affairthe chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death ' s doorbut there does not seem any choicewhat does he want for itit proved to be a bony ,  underfed ,  and dispirited animal ;  but it did not look like dying just yetbutterbur paid for it himself ,  and offered merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animalshe was an honest man ,  and well - off as things were reckoned in bree ;  but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him ,  and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bearas a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the endit turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolenthe others had been driven off ,  or had bolted in terror ,  and were found wandering in different corners of the bree - landmerry ' s ponies had escaped altogether ,  and eventually  ( having a good deal of sense )  they made their way to the downs in search of fatty lumpkinso they came under the care of tom bombadil for a while ,  and were well - offbut when news of the events at bree came to tom ' s ears ,  he sent them to mrbutterbur ,  who thus got five good beasts at a very fair pricethey had to work harder in bree ,  but bob treated them well ;  so on the whole they were lucky :  they missed a dark and dangerous journeybut they never came to rivendellhowever ,  in the meanwhile for all mrbutterbur knew his money was gone for good ,  or for badand he had other troublesfor there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the innthe southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly ,  until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night ,  none other than bill ferny ' s squint - eyed companionsuspicion fell on him at oncego and ask ferny where your handsome friend isafter their breakfast the hobbits had to re - pack ,  and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expectingit was close on ten o ' clock before they at last got offby that time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitementfrodo ' s vanishing trick ;  the appearance of the black horsemen ;  the robbing of the stables ;  and not least the news that strider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits ,  made such a tale as would last for many uneventful yearsmost of the inhabitants of bree and staddle ,  and many even from combe and archet ,  were crowded in the road to see the travellers startthe other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windowsstrider had changed his mind ,  and he decided to leave bree by the main roadany attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse :  half the inhabitants would follow them ,  to see what they were up to ,  and to prevent them from trespassingthey said farewell to nob and bob ,  and took leave of mrbutterbur with many thanksnot all the faces were friendly ,  nor all the words that were shoutedbut strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the bree - landers ,  and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew awayhe walked in front with frodo ;  next came merry and pippin ;  and last came sam leading the pony ,  which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it ;  but already it looked less dejected ,  as if it approved of the change in its fortunessam was chewing an apple thoughtfullyhe had a pocket full of them :  a parting present from nob and bobbut as they drew near to the further gate ,  frodo saw a dark ill - kept house behind a thick hedge :  the last house in the villagein one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly ,  slanting eyes ;  but it vanished at oncehe had heavy black brows ,  and dark scornful eyes ;  his large mouth curled in a sneerhe was smoking a short black pipeas they approached he took it out of his mouth and spatfound some friends at lastthat ' s stick - at - naught strider ,  that isthough i ' ve heard other names not so prettywatch out tonightand you ,  sammie ,  don ' t go ill - treating my poor old ponysam turned quicklyferny ,  '  he said ,   ' put your ugly face out of sight ,  or it will get hurthe ducked too late ,  and curses came from behind the hedgeat last they left the village behindthe escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the south - gatepassing through ,  they kept on along the road for some milesit bent to the left ,  curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of bree - hill ,  and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded countryto their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit - holes of staddle on the gentler south - eastern slopes of the hill ;  down in a deep hollow away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where combe lay ;      archet was hidden in the trees beyondafter the road had run down some way ,  and had left bree - hill standing tall and brown behind ,  they came on a narrow track that led off towards the northno one was in sight ;  and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valleyhis plan ,  as far as they could understand it without knowing the country ,  was to go towards archet at first ,  but to bear right and pass it on the east ,  and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to weathertop hillin that way they would ,  if all went well ,  cut off a great loop of the road ,  which further on bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshesbut ,  of course ,  they would have to pass through the marshes themselves ,  and strider ' s description of them was not encouraginghowever ,  in the meanwhile ,  walking was not unpleasantindeed ,  if it had not been for the disturbing events of the night before ,  they would have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that timethe sun was shining ,  clear but not too hotthe woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour ,  and seemed peaceful and wholesomestrider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths ,  although left to themselves they would soon have been at a losshe was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings ,  to put off any pursuithe knows the land round here well enough ,  but he knows he is not a match for me in a woodit is what he may tell others that i am afraid ofi don ' t suppose they are far awayif they think we have made for archet ,  so much the betterthe next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards ;  and still all was quiet and peacefulon the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwoodthe land had been falling steadily ,  ever since they turned aside from the road ,  and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country ,  much more difficult to managethey were far beyond the borders of the bree - land ,  out in the pathless wilderness ,  and drawing near to the midge - water marshesthe ground now became damp ,  and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools ,  and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birdsthey had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry - footed and on their proper courseat first they made fan - progress ,  but as they went on ,  their passage became slower and more dangerousthe marshes were bewildering and treacherous ,  and there was no permanent trail even for rangers to find through their shifting quagmiresthe flies began to torment them ,  and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hairthere are more midges than waterthey spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant countrytheir camping - place was damp ,  cold ,  and uncomfortable ;  and the biting insects would not let them sleepthere were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricketthere were thousands of them ,  and they squeaked all round ,  neek - breek ,  breek - neek ,  unceasingly all the night ,  until the hobbits were nearly franticthe next day ,  the fourth ,  was little better ,  and the night almost as comfortlessthough the neekerbreekers  ( as sam called them )  had been left behind ,  the midges still pursued themas frodo lay ,  tired but unable to close his eyes ,  it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky :  it flashed and faded many timesit was not the dawn ,  for that was still some hours offit is like lightning that leaps up from the hill - topsat last he passed into uneasy sleepthey had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reed - beds of the marshes behind themthe land before them began steadily to rise againaway in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hillsthe highest of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the othersit had a conical top ,  slightly flattened at the summitwe might reach it by noon tomorrow ,  if we go straight towards iti suppose we had better do soit is close to the roadif he comes this way at all ,  he may not pass through bree ,  and so he may not know what we are doingand anyway ,  unless by luck we arrive almost together ,  we shall miss one another ;  it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there longif the riders fail to find us in the wilderness ,  they are likely to make for weathertop themselvesit commands a wide view all roundindeed ,  there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us ,  as we stand here ,  from that hill - topnot all the birds are to be trusted ,  and there are other spies more evil than they aresam looked up into the pale sky ,  fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyesthere we can strike a path i know that runs at their feet ;  it will bring us to weathertop from the north and less openlythen we shall see what we shall seethe land became drier and more barren ;  but mists and vapours lay behind them on the marshesa few melancholy birds were piping and wailing ,  until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows ;  then an empty silence fellthe hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of bag end far awayat the day ' s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland ,  and they went up along its banks while the light lastedit was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder - trees by the shores of the streamahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hillsthat night they set a watch ,  and strider ,  it seemed ,  did not sleep at allthe moon was waxing ,  and in the early night - hours a cold grey light lay on the landnext morning they set out again soon after sunrisethere was a frost in the air ,  and the sky was a pale clear bluethe hobbits felt refreshed ,  as if they had had a night of unbroken sleepalready they were getting used to much walking on short commons ñ shorter at any rate than what in the shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legspippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had beeni hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely ,  or i shall become a wraiththe hills drew nearerthey made an undulating ridge ,  often rising almost to a thousand feet ,  and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyondalong the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green - grown walls and dikes ,  and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stoneby night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes ,  and there they campedit was the night of the fifth of october ,  and they were six days out from breein the morning they found ,  for the first time since they had left the chetwood ,  a track plain to seethey turned right and followed it southwardsit ran cunningly ,  taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view ,  both of the hill - tops above and of the flats to the westit dived into dells ,  and hugged steep banks ;  and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedgeis there any barrow on weathertopthere is no barrow on weathertop ,  nor on any of these hills ,  '  answered striderthis path was made to serve the forts along the wallsbut long before ,  in the first days of the north kingdom ,  they built a great watch - tower on weathertop ,  amon s˚l they called itit was burned and broken ,  and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring ,  like a rough crown on the old hill ' s headyet once it was tall and fairit is told that elendil stood there watching for the coming of gil - galad out of the west ,  in the days of the last allianceit seemed that he was learned in old lore ,  as well as in the ways of the wildsuddenly a low voice murmured :           gil - galad was an elven - kingof him the harpers sadly sing :            the last whose realm was fair and free           between the mountains and the seahis sword was long ,  his lance was keen ,            his shining helm afar was seen ;            the countless stars of heaven ' s field           were mirrored in his silver shieldbut long ago he rode away ,            and where he dwelleth none can say ;            for into darkness fell his star           in mordor where the shadows arethe others turned in amazement ,  for the voice was sam ' sbilbo when i was a ladhe used to tell me tales like that ,  knowing how i was always one for hearing about elvesbilbo as taught me my lettershe was mighty book - learned was dear old mrand he wrote poetryhe wrote what i have just saidbilbo must have translated iti never knew thati didn ' t learn that part ,  it gave me the shivers i never thought i should be going that way myselfit was already mid - day when they drew near the southern end of the path ,  and saw before them ,  in the pale clear light of the october sun ,  a grey - green bank ,  leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill they decided to make for the top at once ,  while the daylight was broad concealment was no longer possible ,  and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing themnothing was to be seen moving on the hillif gandalf was anywhere about ,  there was no sign of himon the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow ,  at the bottom of which there was a bowl - shaped dell with grassy sidesthere they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggagethe other three went onafter half an hour ' s plodding climb strider reached the crown of the hill ;  frodo and merry followed ,  tired and breathlessthe last slope had been steep and rockyon the top they found ,  as strider had said ,  a wide ring of ancient stonework ,  now crumbling or covered with age - long grassbut in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piledthey were blackened as if with fireabout them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled ,  as if flames had swept the hill - top ;  but there was no sign of any living thingstanding upon the rim of the ruined circle ,  they saw all round below them a wide prospect ,  for the most pan of lands empty and featureless ,  except for patches of woodland away to the south ,  beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant waterbeneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the old road ,  coming out of the west and winding up and down ,  until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the eastnothing was moving on itfollowing its line eastward with their eyes they saw the mountains :  the nearer foothills were brown and sombre ;      behind them stood taller shapes of grey ,  and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the cloudsthere is no water and no shelterand no sign of gandalfbut i don ' t blame him for not waiting ñ if he ever came herehe can ride very swiftly when need presseshe picked it up and examined it ,  turning it in his fingersthe scratches are fine ,  and they certainly look freshbut the marks might mean something quite different ,  and have nothing to do with usrangers use runes ,  and they come here sometimesit would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand ,  so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainerif that is so ,  we must be warythere have been scorching flames here ;  and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mindi guess that he was attacked on this hill - top ,  but with what result i cannot tellhe is here no longer ,  and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell ,  as best we can  '       ' how far is rivendellthe world looked wild and wide from weathertopit is a strange road ,  and folk are glad to reach their journey ' s end ,  whether the time is long or shortbut i know how long it would take me on my own feet ,  with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen ,  where the road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rivendellwe have at least a fortnight ' s journey before us ,  for i do not think we shall be able to use the roadthey stood for a while silent on the hill - top ,  near its southward edgein that lonely place frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and dangerhe wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved shirehe stared down at the hateful road ,  leading back westward ñ to his homesuddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it ,  going westward ;  and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet themhe gave a cry and clutched strider ' s armat once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle ,  pulling frodo down beside himmerry threw himself alongsideslowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again ,  and peered through a cleft between two jagged stonesthe light was no longer bright ,  for the clear morning had faded ,  and clouds creeping out of the east had now overtaken the sun ,  as it began to go downthey could all see the black specks ,  but neither frodo nor merry could make out their shapes for certain ;  yet something told them that there ,  far below ,  were black riders assembling on the road beyond the foot of the hillsam and peregrin had not been idlethey had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopesnot far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside ,  and near it footprints not more than a day or two oldin the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire ,  and other signs of a hasty campthere were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hillbehind them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stackedrangers have been here latelyit is they who left the firewood behindbut there are also several newer tracks that were not made by rangersat least one set was made ,  only a day or two ago ,  by heavy bootsat least onei cannot now be certain ,  but i think there were many booted feeteach of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted ridersif the horsemen had already found the dell ,  the sooner strider led them somewhere else the bettersam viewed the hollow with great dislike ,  now that he had heard news of their enemies on the road ,  only a few miles awayat least we are out of sight for the moment ,  and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spiesall we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills ,  where the land is all much the same as it is herethe road is watched ,  but we should have to cross it ,  if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the southon the north side of the road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for milesbut you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below ;  and now you talk of being seen ,  if we movefor the black horses can see ,  and the riders can use men and other creatures as spies ,  as we found at breethey themselves do not see the world of light as we do ,  but our shapes cast shadows in their minds ,  which only the noon sun destroys ;  and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us :  then they are most to be fearedand at all times they smell the blood of living things ,  desiring and hating itsenses ,  too ,  there are other than sight or smellwe can feel their presence ñ it troubled our hearts ,  as soon as we came here ,  and before we saw them ;  they feel ours more keenlyalso ,  '  he added ,  and his voice sank to a whisper ,   ' the ring draws themif i stay ,  i shall draw

hunger ,  for they had not eaten anything since breakfast ;  but they dared not make more than a frugal supperthe lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts ,  unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the worldrangers passed at times beyond the hills ,  but they were few and did not stayother wanderers were rare ,  and of evil sort :  trolls might stray down at times out of the

starsfrodo and his companions huddled round the fire ,  wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed ;  but strider was content with a single cloak ,  and sat a little apart ,  drawing thoughtfully at his pipeas night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fearhe knew many histories and legends of long ago ,

thickly strewn ,            by light of moon and ray of star            in frosty heavens shiveringher mantle glinted in the moon ,             as on a hill - top high and far           she danced ,

came ,            and doom fell on tin˙viel            that in his arms lay glisteningas beren looked into her eyes            within the shadows of her hair ,            the trembling starlight of

paused before he spoke againit tells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and l˙thien tin˙vielberen was a mortal man ,  but l˙thien was the daughter of thingol ,  a king of elves upon middle - earth when the world was young ;  and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this worldas the stars above the mists of the northern lands was her loveliness ,  and in her face was a shining lightin those days the great enemy ,  of whom sauron of mordor was but a servant ,  dwelt in angband in the north ,  and the elves of the west coming back to middle - earth made war upon him to regain the silmarils which he had stolen ;  and the fathers of men aided the elvesbut the enemy was victorious and barahir was slain ,  and beren escaping through great peril came over the mountains of terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreththere he beheld l˙thien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river esgalduin ;  and he named her tin˙viel ,  that is nightingale in the language of oldmany sorrows befell them afterwards ,  and they were parted longtin˙viel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron ,  and together they passed through great dangers ,  and cast down even the great enemy from his throne ,  and took from his iron crown one of the three silmarils ,  brightest of all jewels ,  to be the bride - price of l˙thien to thingol her fatheryet at the last beren was slain by the wolf that came from the gates of angband ,  and he died in the arms of tin˙vielbut she chose mortality ,  and to die from the world ,  so that she might follow him ;  and it is sung that they met again beyond the sundering seas ,  and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods ,  together they passed ,  long ago ,  beyond the confines of this worldso it is that l˙thien tin˙viel alone of the elf - kindred has died indeed and left the world ,  and they have lost her whom they most lovedbut from her the lineage of the elf - lords of old descended among menthere live still those of whom l˙thien was the foremother ,  and it is said that her line shall never failelrond of rivendell is of that kinfor of beren and l˙thien was born dior thingol ' s heir ;  and of him elwing the white whom e‰rendil wedded ,  he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his browand of e‰rendil came the kings of n˙menor ,  that is westernessehis eyes shone ,  and his voice was rich and deepabove him was a black starry skysuddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behind himthe waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them ,  and the stars above the hill - top fadedthe story endedthe hobbits moved and stretchedeven as they did so ,  they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonriseit was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale lightsam and merry got up and walked away from the firefrodo and pippin remained seated in silencestrider was watching the moonlight on the hill intentlyall seemed quiet and still ,  but frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart ,  now that strider was no longer speakinghe huddled closer to the fireat that moment sam came running back from the edge of the delli durstn ' t go outside this dell for any money ;  i felt that something was creeping up the slopei saw nothing ,  but i didn ' t stop to lookthey seemed to be moving this waynothing happenedthere was no sound or movement in the nightfrodo stirred ,  feeling that he must break the silence :  he longed to shout out aloudover the lip of the little dell ,  on the side away from the hill ,  they felt ,  rather than saw ,  a shadow rise ,  one shadow or more than onethey strained their eyes ,  and the shadows seemed to growsoon there could be no doubt :      three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope ,  looking down on themso black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind themfrodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chillthen the shapes slowly advancedterror overcame pippin and merry ,  and they threw themselves flat on the groundsam shrank to frodo ' s sidefrodo was hardly less terrified than his companions ;  he was quaking as if he was bitter cold ,  but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ringthe desire to do this laid hold of him ,  and he could think of nothing elsehe did not forget the barrow ,  nor the message of gandalf ;  but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings ,  and he longed to yieldnot with the hope of escape ,  or of doing anything ,  either good or bad :  he simply felt that he must take the ring and put it on his fingerhe could not speakhe felt sam looking at him ,  as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble ,  but he could not turn towards himhe shut his eyes and struggled for a while ;  but resistance became unbearable ,  and at last he slowly drew out the chain ,  and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left handimmediately ,  though everything else remained as before ,  dim and dark ,  the shapes became terribly clearhe was able to see beneath their black wrappingsthere were five tall figures :  two standing on the lip of the dell ,  three advancingin their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes ;  under their mantles were long grey robes ;  upon their grey hairs were helms of silver ;  in their haggard hands were swords of steeltheir eyes fell on him and pierced him ,  as they rushed towards himdesperate ,  he drew his own sword ,  and it seemed to him that it flickered red ,  as if it was a firebrandtwo of the figures haltedthe third was taller than the others :  his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crownin one hand he held a long sword ,  and in the other a knife ;  both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale lighthe sprang forward and bore down on frodoat that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground ,  and he heard himself crying aloud :  o elberethat the same time he struck at the feet of his enemya shrill cry rang out in the night ;  and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shouldereven as he swooned he caught ,  as through a swirling mist ,  a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either handwith a last effort frodo ,  dropping his sword ,  slipped the ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon itchapter 12            flight to the ford     when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperatelyhe was lying by the fire ,  which was now piled high and burning brightlyhis three companions were bending over himwhere is the pale kingthey were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while ;  nor did they understand his questionat length he gathered from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards themsuddenly to his horror sam found that his master had vanished ;  and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him ,  and he fellhe heard frodo ' s voice ,  but it seemed to come from a great distance ,  or from under the earth ,  crying out strange wordsthey saw nothing more ,  until they stumbled over the body of frodo ,  lying as if dead ,  face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath himstrider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire ,  and then he disappearedthat was now a good while agosam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider ;  but while they were talking he returned ,  appearing suddenly out of the shadowsthey started ,  and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo ;  but strider knelt down swiftly at his sidei have been trying to discover something of their movements ;  but i have found nothingi cannot think why they have gone and do not attack againbut there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at handthen he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles ,  and to bathe the wound with itthen he got up and walked away ,  and called sam to himwhy they were not all here ,  i don ' t know ;  but i don ' t think they expected to be resistedthey have drawn off for the time beingbut not far ,  i fearthey will come again another night ,  if we cannot escapethey are only waiting ,  because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished ,  and that the ring cannot fly much furtheri fear ,  sam ,  that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their willwe shall seeyour frodo is made of sterner stuff than i had guessed ,  though gandalf hinted that it might prove sohe is not slain ,  and i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expecti will do all i can to help and heal himguard him well ,  while i am awayfrodo dozed ,  though the pain of his wound was slowly growing ,  and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and sidehis friends watched over him ,  warming him ,  and bathing his woundthe night passed slowly and wearilydawn was growing in the sky ,  and the dell was filling with grey light ,  when strider at last returneda foot above the lower hem there was a slashmore deadly to him was the name of elbereththere was a cold gleam in itas strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken offbut even as he held it up in the growing light ,  they gazed in astonishment ,  for the blade seemed to melt ,  and vanished like a smoke in the air ,  leaving only the hilt in strider ' s handfew now have the skill in healing to match such evil weaponsbut i will do what i canthen setting it aside ,  he turned to frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catchfrom the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plantathelas they named it ,  and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old ;  and it is not known in the north ,  except to some of those who wander in the wildit has great virtues ,  but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be smallthe fragrance of the steam was refreshing ,  and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and clearedthe herb had also some power over the wound ,  for frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side ;  but the life did not return to his arm ,  and he could not raise or use his handhe bitterly regretted his foolishness ,  and reproached himself for weakness of will ;  for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemieshe wondered if he would remain maimed for life ,  and how they would now manage to continue their journeyhe fell too weak to standthe others were discussing this very questionthey quickly decided to leave weathertop as soon as possibleif gandalf ever came here ,  then he must have been forced to ride away ,  and he will not returnin any case we are in great peril here after dark ,  since the attack of last night ,  and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we goit was impossible for frodo to walk ,  so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them ,  and put frodo on the ponyin the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully ;  it already seemed fatter and stronger ,  and had begun to show an affection for its new masters ,  especially for sambill ferny ' s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former lifethey started off in a southerly directionthis would mean crossing the road ,  butit was the quickest way to more wooded countryand they needed fuel ;  for strider said that frodo must be kept warm ,  especially at night ,  while fire would be some protection for them allit was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the road :  east beyond weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwardsthey made their way slowly and cautiously round the south - western slopes of the hill ,  and came in a little while to the edge of the roadthere was no sign of the ridersbut even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries :  a cold voice calling and a cold voice answeringtrembling they sprang forward ,  and made for the thickets that lay aheadthe land before them sloped away southwards ,  but it was wild and pathless ;  bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in betweenthe grass was scanty ,  coarse ,  and grey ;  and the leaves in the thickets were faded and fallingit was a cheerless land ,  and their journey was slow and gloomythey spoke little as they trudged alongfrodo ' s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down ,  and their backs bowed under their burdenseven strider seemed tired and heavy - heartedbefore the first day ' s march was over frodo ' s pain began to grow again ,  but he did not speak of it for a long timefour days passed ,  without the ground or the scene changing much ,  except that behind them weathertop slowly sank ,  and before them the distant mountains loomed a little neareryet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed themthey dreaded the dark hours ,  and kept watch in pairs by night ,  expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night ,  dimly lit by the cloud - veiled moon ;  but they saw nothing ,  and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grassnot once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dellit seemed too much to hope that the riders had already lost their trail againperhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow placeat the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descendedstrider now turned their course again north - eastwards ,  and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow - climbing slope ,  and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hillsaway below them they could see the road sweeping round the feet of the hills ;  and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshinein the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half - veiled in mistit flows down out of the ettenmoors ,  the troll - fells north of rivendell ,  and joins the loudwater away in the southsome call it the greyflood after thatit is a great water before it finds the seathere is no way over it below its sources in the ettenmoors ,  except by the last bridge on which the road crossesbut i have not yet thought how we shall cross that waterone river at a timewe shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the last bridge held against ussam and strider went forward ,  but they found no sign of any travellers or ridershere under the shadow of the hills there had been some rainstrider judged that it had fallen two days before ,  and had washed away all footprintsno horseman had passed since then ,  as far as he could seethey hurried along with all the speed they could make ,  and after a mile or two they saw the last bridge ahead ,  at the bottom of a short steep slopethey dreaded to see black figures waiting there ,  but they saw nonestrider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road ,  while he went forward to explorebefore long he came hurrying backbut i have found something very strangewhether it was set there ,  or let fall by chance ,  i cannot say ;  but it brings hope to mei will take it as a sign that we may pass the bridge ;  but beyond that i dare not keep to the road ,  without some clearer tokenthey crossed the bridge in safety ,  hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great archesa mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the roadhere strider turned aside ,  and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hillsthe hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous road behind them ;  but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendlyas they went forward the hills about them steadily rosehere and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone ,  and the ruins of towers :  they had an ominous lookfrodo ,  who was not walking ,  had time to gaze ahead and to thinkhe recalled bilbo ' s account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the road ,  in the country near the troll ' s wood where his first serious adventure had happenedfrodo guessed that they were now in the same region ,  and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spotis this troll - countryno one lives in this landmen once dwelt here ,  ages ago ;  but none remain nowthey became an evil people ,  as legends tell ,  for they fell under the shadow of angmarbut all were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its endbut that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them ,  though a shadow still lies on the landthere my heart is ;  but it is not my fate to sit in peace ,  even in the fair house of elrondthe road behind held on its way to the river bruinen ,  but both were now hidden from viewthe travellers came into a long valley ;  narrow ,  deeply cloven ,  dark and silenttrees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs ,  and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine - woodthe hobbits grew very wearythey advanced slowly ,  for they had to pick their way through a pathless country ,  encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocksas long as they could they avoided climbing for frodo ' s sake ,  and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dalesthey had been two days in this country when the weather turned wetthe wind began to blow steadily out of the west and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rainby nightfall they were all soaked ,  and their camp was cheerless ,  for they could not get any fire to burnthe next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them ,  and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their coursestrider seemed to be getting anxious :  they were nearly ten days out from weathertop ,  and their stock of provisions was beginning to run lowit went on rainingthat night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock - wall behind them ,  in which there was a shallow cave ,  a mere scoop in the clifffrodo was restlessthe cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever ,  and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleephe lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night - noises :  wind in chinks of rock ,  water dripping ,  a crack ,  the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stonehe felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him ;  but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of strider sitting hunched up ,  smoking his pipe ,  and watchinghe lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream ,  in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the shire ,  but it seemed faint and dim ,  less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedgein the morning he woke to find that the rain had stoppedthe clouds were still thick ,  but they were breaking ,  and pale strips of blue appeared between themthe wind was shifting againthey did not start earlyimmediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off alone ,  telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff ,  until he came backhe was going to climb up ,  if he could ,  and get a look at the lie of the landwhen he returned he was not reassuringif we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the ettendales far north of rivendellthat is troll - country ,  and little known to mewe could perhaps find our way through and come round to rivendell from the north ;  but it would take too long ,  for i do not know the way ,  and our food would not lastso somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinenthey found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south - east ,  the direction that they wished to take ;  but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land ;  its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted sawthey had a choice between going back or climbing over itthey decided to attempt the climb ,  but it proved very difficultbefore long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on footeven so they often despaired of getting their pony up ,  or indeed of finding a path for themselves ,  burdened as they werethe light was nearly gone ,  and they were all exhausted ,  when at last they reached the topthey had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points ,  and the land fell steeply away again ,  only a short distance aheadfrodo threw himself down ,  and lay on the ground shiveringhis left arm was lifeless ,  and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon themthe trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dimi am dreadfully anxious about himwhat are we to dodo you think they will be able to cure him in rivendell ,  if we ever get therebut i agree that we can go no further tonightthere ' s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulderbut do not give up hope ,  samthey lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine ,  that hung over a shallow pit :  it looked as if stone had once been quarried therethey sat huddled togetherthe wind blew chill through the pass ,  and they heard the tree - tops lower down moaning and sighingfrodo lay half in a dream ,  imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him ,  and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hillsthe morning dawned bright and fair ;  the air was clean ,  and the light pale and clear in a rain - washed skytheir hearts were encouraged ,  but  ( hey longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbsas soon as it was light ,  strider took merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the passthe sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting newsthey were now going more or less in the right directionif they went on ,  down the further side of the ridge ,  they would have the mountains on their leftsome way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the loudwater again ,  and he knew that ,  though it was hidden from view ,  the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the side nearest to themwhatever danger may beset it ,  the road is our only way to the fordthey climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge ;  but the way was much easier than they had expected ,  for the slope was far less steep on this side ,  and before long frodo was able to ride againbill ferny ' s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path ,  and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possiblethe spirits of the party rose againeven frodo felt better in the morning light ,  but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight ,  and he passed his hands over his eyespippin was a little ahead of the otherssuddenly he turned round and called to themwhen they came up with him ,  they saw that he had made no mistake :      there were clearly the beginnings of a path ,  that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill - top behindin places it was now faint and overgrown ,  or choked with fallen stones and trees ;  but at one time it seemed to have been much usedit was a path made by strong arms and heavy feethere and there old trees had been cut or broken down ,  and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a waythey followed the track for some while ,  for it offered much the easiest way down ,  but they went cautiously ,  and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods ,  and the path grew plainer and broadersuddenly coming out of a belt of fir - trees it ran steeply down a slope ,  and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hillwhen they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with treesin the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hingeoutside the door they all haltedthere was a cave or rock - chamber behind ,  but in the gloom inside nothing could be seenstrider ,  sam ,  and merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider ,  and then strider and merry went inthey did not go far ,  for on the floor lay many old bones ,  and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken potsnow we know who made the path  - and we had better get off it quicki don ' t think we need be afraidbut let us go on down warily ,  and we shall seepippin ,  not liking to show strider that he was still afraid ,  went on ahead with merrysam and strider came behind ,  one on each side of frodo ' s pony ,  for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreastbut they had not gone very far before pippin came running back ,  followed by merrythey both looked terrifiedwe got a sight of them through the tree - trunksthey are very largefrodo said nothing ,  but sam looked scaredthe sun was now high ,  and it shone down through the half - stripped branches of the trees ,  and lit the clearing with bright patches of lightthey halted suddenly on the edge ,  and peered through the tree - trunks ,  holding their breaththere stood the trolls :  three large trollsone was stooping ,  and the other two stood staring at himstrider walked forward unconcernedlynothing happenedthere was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits ,  and then even frodo laughedthese must be the very three that were caught by gandalf ,  quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbithe knew the story wellbilbo and frodo had told it often ;  but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed iteven now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion ,  wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life againin any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird ' s nest behind his earthat would be a most unusual ornament for a live trollfrodo felt his spirits reviving :  the reminder of bilbo ' s first successful adventure was hearteningthe sun ,  too ,  was warm and comforting ,  and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a littlethey rested for some time in the glade ,  and took their mid - day meal right under the shadow of the trolls '  large legsthe others looked at himperhaps sam could dig something out of his memoryit ain ' t what i call proper poetry ,  if you understand me :  just a bit of nonsensebut these old images here brought it to my mindtroll sat alone on his seat of stone ,            and munched and mumbled a bare old bone ;            for many a year he had gnawed it near ,            for meat was hard to come byin a case in the hills he dwelt alone ,            and meat was hard to come byup came tom with his big boots onsaid he to troll :   ' pray ,  what is yonfor it looks like the shin o '  my nuncle tim ,            as should be a - lyin '  in graveyardthis many a year has tim been gone ,            and i thought he were lyin '  in graveyardbut what be bones that lie in a holethy nuncle was dead as a lump o '  lead ,            afore i found his shinbonehe can spare a share for a poor old troll ,            for he don ' t need his shinbonethough dead he be ,  it belongs to he ;            so hand the old bone overa bit o '  fresh meal will go down sweeti ' ll try my teeth on thee nowi ' m tired o '  gnawing old bones and skins ;            i ' ve a mind to dine on thee nowbefore he could mind ,  tom slipped behind           and gave him the boot to larn hima bump o '  the boot on the seat ,  tom thought ,            would be the way to larn himbut harder than stone is the flesh and bone           of a troll that sits in the hills aloneas well set your boot to the mountain ' s root ,            for the seat of a troll don ' t feel itold troll laughed ,  when he heard tom groan ,            and he knew his toes could feel ittom ' s leg is game ,  since home he came ,            and his bootless foot is lasting lame ;            but troll don ' t care ,  and he ' s still there           with the bone he boned from its ownertroll ' s old seat is still the same ,            and the bone he boned from its ownerfirst he was a conspirator ,  now he ' s a jesterhe ' ll end up by becoming a wizard ñ or a warriorthey were probably following the very track that gandalf ,  bilbo ,  and the dwarves had used many years beforeafter a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the roadat this point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley ,  and now clung close to the feet of the hills ,  rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather - covered slopes towards the ford and the mountainsnot far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grasson it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf - runes and secret markshow much is left of bilbo ' s share ,  i wonder ,  frodohe told me he did not feel it was really his ,  as it came from robbersthere was no sign of any other travellers to be seenas there was now no other possible course for them to take ,  they climbed down the bank ,  and turning left went off as fast as they couldsoon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering suna cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains aheadthey were beginning to look out for a place off the road ,  where they could camp for the night ,  when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts :  the noise of hoofs behind themthey looked back ,  but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the roadas quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above ,  until they came to a small patch of thick - growing hazelsas they peered out from among the bushes ,  they could see the road ,  faint and grey in the failing light ,  some thirty feel below themthe sound of hoofs drew nearerthey were going fast ,  with a light clippety - clippely - clipthen faintly ,  as if it was blown away from them by the breeze ,  they seemed to catch a dim ringing ,  as of small bells tinklingthe other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not ,  but they all remained full of suspicionthey had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendlybut strider was now leaning forward ,  stooped to the ground ,  with a hand to his ear ,  and a look of joy on his facethe light faded ,  and the leaves on the bushes rustled softlyclearer and nearer now the bells jingled ,  and clippety - clip came the quick trotting feetsuddenly into view below came a white horse ,  gleaming in the shadows ,  running swiftlyin the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed ,  as if it were studded with gems like living starsthe rider ' s cloak streamed behind him ,  and his hood was thrown back ;  his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speedto frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider ,  as if through a thin veilstrider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road ,  leaping with a cry through the heather ;  but even before he had moved or called ,  the rider had reined in his horse and halted ,  looking up towards the thicket where they stoodwhen he saw strider ,  he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out :  ai na vedui d˙nadanmae govannenhis speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts :  the rider was of the elven - folkno others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hearbut there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call ,  and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to stridersoon strider beckoned to them ,  and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the roadwe feared that you were in danger upon the roadhe had not when i departed ;  but that was nine days ago ,  '  answered glorfindelsome of my kindred ,  journeying in your land beyond the baranduin ,  learned that things were amiss ,  and sent messages as swiftly as they couldthey said that the nine were abroad ,  and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance ,  for gandalf had not returnedthere are few even in rivendell that can ride openly against the nine ;  but such as there were ,  elrond sent out north ,  west ,  and southit was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit ,  and become lost in the wildernessthree of the servants of sauron were upon the bridge ,  but they withdrew and i pursued them westwardi came also upon two others ,  but they turned away southwardsince then i have searched for your trailtwo days ago i found it ,  and followed it over the bridge ;  and today i marked where you descended from the hills againthere is no time for further newssince you are here we must risk the peril of the road and gothere are five behind us ,  and when they find your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the windand they are not allwhere the other four may be ,  i do not knowi fear that we may find the ford is already held against usfrodo felt a great weariness come over himever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened ,  and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friendsnow pain assailed him ,  and he felt coldhe swayed ,  clutching at sam ' s armhe needs restbriefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop ,  and of the deadly knifehe drew out the hilt ,  which he had kept ,  and handed it to the elfglorfindel shuddered as he took it ,  but he looked intently at itkeep it ,  aragorn ,  till we reach the house of elrondbut be wary ,  and handle it as little as you maythe wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heali will do what i can ñ but all the more do i urge you now to go on without restbut frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm ;  a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand ,  and the pain grew easierthe dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him ,  as if a cloud had been withdrawnhe saw his friends '  faces more clearly again ,  and a measure of new hope and strength returnedbut you need not fear :  my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him to bearhis pace is light and smooth ;  and if danger presses too near ,  he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rivalthe pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace ,  i thinkit is you ,  frodo ,  and that which you bear that brings us all in perilthe pony was laden instead with a great part of the others '  burdens ,  so that they now marched lighter ,  and for a time made good speed ;  but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the elfon he led them ,  into the mouth of darkness ,  and still on under the deep clouded nightthere was neither star nor moonnot until the grey of dawn did he allow them to haltpippin ,  merry ,  and sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs ;  and even strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be wearyfrodo sat upon the horse in a dark dreamthey cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road - side ,  and fell asleep immediatelythey seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel ,  who had set himself to watch while they slept ,  awoke them againthe sun had now climbed far into the morning ,  and the clouds and mists of the night were goneit was clear as spring water and had no taste ,  and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth ;  but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank iteaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit  ( which was now all that they had left )  seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had donethey had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the road againglorfindel still urged them on ,  and only allowed two brief halts during the day ' s marchin this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall ,  and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley ,  now making straight for the bruinenso far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear ;  but often glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment ,  if they lagged behind ,  and a look of anxiety clouded his faceonce or twice he spoke to strider in the elf - tonguebut however anxious their guides might be ,  it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that nightthey were stumbling along dizzy with weariness ,  and unable to think of anything but their feet and legsfrodo ' s pain had redoubled ,  and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly greyhe almost welcomed the coming of night ,  for then the world seemed less pale and emptythe hobbits were still weary ,  when they set out again early next morningthere were many miles yet to go between them and the ford ,  and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could managein the late afternoon they came to a place where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine - trees ,  and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stoneechoes ran along as they hurried forward ;  and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their ownall at once ,  as if through a gate of light ,  the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the openthere at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile ,  and beyond that the ford of rivendellon the further side was a steep brown bank ,  threaded by a winding path ;  and behind that the tall mountains climbed ,  shoulder above shoulder ,  and peak beyond peak ,  into the fading skythere was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them ;  a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pinesone moment glorfindel turned and listened ,  then he sprang forward with a loud crythe enemy is upon usthe hobbits ran down the slopeglorfindel and strider followed as rear - guardthey were only half way across the flat ,  when suddenly there was a noise of horses gallopingout of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a black riderhe reined his horse in ,  and halted ,  swaying in his saddleanother followed him ,  and then another ;  then again two morehe did not obey at once ,  for a strange reluctance seized himchecking the horse to a walk ,  he turned and looked backthe riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill ,  dark and solid ,  while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mistsuddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to waitthen at once fear and hatred awoke in himhis hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword ,  and with a red flash he drew itat once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the roadat the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit ,  and from the riders came a terrible cry ,  such as frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far awayit was answered ;  and to the dismay of frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other riders came flyingtwo rode towards frodo :  two galloped madly towards the ford to cut off his escapethey seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker ,  as their courses converged with hisfrodo looked back for a moment over his shoulderhe could no longer see his friendsthe riders behind were falling back :  even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf - horse of glorfindelhe looked forward again ,  and hope fadedthere seemed no chance of reaching the ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambushhe could see them clearly now :  they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks ,  and they were robed in white and greyswords were naked in their pale hands ;  helms were on their headstheir cold eyes glittered ,  and they called to him with fell voicesfear now filled all frodo ' s mindhe thought no longer of his swordno cry came from himhe shut his eyes and clung to the horse ' s manethe wind whistled in his ears ,  and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrilla breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear ,  as with a last spurt ,  like a flash of white fire ,  the elf - horse speeding as if on wings ,  passed right before the face of the foremost riderfrodo heard the splash of waterit foamed about his feethe felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony pathhe was climbing the steep bankhe was across the fordbut the pursuers were close behindat the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercelythere were nine riders at the water ' s edge below ,  and frodo ' s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faceshe knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done ;  and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell ,  if once the riders crossedin any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halthatred again stirred in him ,  but he had no longer the strength to refusesuddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forwardit checked at the water and reared upwith a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished his swordthe riders halted ,  but frodo had not the power of bombadilhis enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughterfrodo was stricken dumbhe felt his tongue cleave to his mouth ,  and his heart labouringhis sword broke and fell out of his shaking handthe elf - horse reared and snortedthe foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shoreat that moment there came a roaring and a rushing :  a noise of loud waters rolling many stonesdimly frodo saw the river below him rise ,  and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waveswhite flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manesthe three riders that were still in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed :  they disappeared ,  buried suddenly under angry foamthose that were behind drew back in dismaywith his last failing senses frodo heard cries ,  and it seemed to him that he saw ,  beyond the riders that hesitated on the shore ,  a shining figure of white light ;  and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames ,  that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the worldthe black horses were filled with madness ,  and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing floodtheir piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them awaythen frodo felt himself falling ,  and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemieshe heard and saw no morechapter 1            many meetings     frodo woke and found himself lying in bedat first he thought that he had slept late ,  after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memoryor perhaps he had been illbut the ceiling looked strange ;  it was flat ,  and it had dark beams richly carvedhe lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall ,  and listening to the sound of a waterfallthere was the old wizard ,  sitting in a chair by the open windowand you are lucky to be here ,  too ,  after all the absurd things you have done since you left homehe felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue ,  and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argumenthe was fully awake now ,  and the memory of his journey was returning :  the disastrous `short cut '  through the old forest the `accident '  at the prancing pony ;  and his madness in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertopwhile he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in rivendell ,  there was a long silence ,  broken only by the soft puffs of gandalf ' s pipe ,  as he blew white smoke - rings out of the windowyou were beginning to fade ,  '  answered gandalfa few more hours and you would have been beyond our aidbut you have some strength in you ,  my dear hobbitas you showed in the barrowthat was touch and go :  perhaps the most dangerous moment of alli wish you could have held out at weathertopat first it was too horrible ;  and afterwards there were other things to think abouthow do you know about itdo not worrythough i said  " absurd "  just now ,  i did not mean iti think well of you - and of the othersit is no small feat to have come so far ,  and through such dangers ,  still bearing the ringi did not know what to do without youand yet i am not sure ;  it may have been better soyou are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today ,  by elrond ' s orderswhy were you delayedyou ought to tell me that at leastat the moment i will only say that i was held captivesome are greater than i amagainst some i have not yet been measuredbut my time is comingthe morgul - lord and his black riders have come forthwar is preparingindeed i spoke of them once to you ;  for the black riders are the ringwraiths ,  the nine servants of the lord of the ringsbut i did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at oncei heard news of them only after i left you in june ;  but that story must waitfor the moment we have been saved from disaster ,  by aragornyet i was afraid of him at firstsam never quite trusted himi think ,  not at any rate until we met glorfindelwell ,  fond is not the right wordi mean he is dear to me ;  though he is strange ,  and grim at timesin fact ,  he reminds me often of youi didn ' t know that any of the big people were like thati thought ,  well ,  that they were just big ,  and rather stupid :  kind and stupid like butterbur ;  or stupid and wicked like bill fernybut then we don ' t know much about men in the shire ,  except perhaps the breelandershe thinks less than he talks ,  and slower ;  yet he can see through a brick wall in time  ( as they say in bree )but there are few left in middle - earth like aragorn son of arathornthe race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at an endit may be that this war of the ring will be their last adventurei thought he was only a rangerthey have helped me before ;  and i shall need their help in the days to come ;  for we have reached rivendell ,  but the ring is not yet at restit is very pleasant just to resti have had a month of exile and adventure ,  and i find that has been as much as i wantafter a while he spoke againit ought to be the twenty - firstwe must have reached the ford by the twentiethyes ,  it is coming back to lifeit is not cold ,  '  he added ,  touching his left hand with his rightyou will soon be sound againelrond has cured you :  he has tended you for days ,  ever since you were brought inthe elves brought you from this where you lost countwe have been terribly anxious ,  and sam has hardly left your side ,  day or night ,  except to run messageselrond is a master of healing ,  but the weapons of our enemy are deadlyto tell you the truth ,  i had very little hope ;  for i suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed woundbut it could not be found until last nightthen elrond removed a splinterit was deeply buriedand it was working inwardsit has been meltedand it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantlyi have known strong warriors of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter ,  which you bore for seventeen daysif they had succeeded ,  you would have become like they are ,  only weaker and under their commandyou would have became a wraith under the dominion of the dark lord ;  and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his ring ,  if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his handi was mortally afraid ,  of course ;  but if i had known more ,  i should not have dared even to moveit is a marvel that i escapedfor your heart was not touched ,  and only your shoulder was pierced ;  and that was because you resisted to the lastbut it was a terribly narrow shave ,  so to speakyou were in gravest peril while you wore the ring ,  for then you were half in the wraith - world yourself ,  and they might have seized youyou could see them ,  and they could see youbut why could we all see their horsesall other animals are terrified when they draw near ,  even the elf - horse of glorfindelthe dogs howl and the geese scream at themnot all his servants and chattels are wraithsthere are orcs and trolls ,  there are wargs and werewolves ;  and there have been and still are many men ,  warriors and kings ,  that walk alive under the sun ,  and yet are under his swayand their number is growing dailyis rivendell safethe elves may fear the dark lord ,  and they may fly before him ,  but never again will they listen to him or serve himand here in rivendell there live still some of his chief foes :  the elven - wise ,  lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seasthey do not fear the ringwraiths ,  for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both worlds ,  and against both the seen and the unseen they have great powerwas that glorfindel thenhe is an elf - lord of a house of princesindeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor ,  for a while :  and elsewhere other powers still dwellthere is power ,  too ,  of another kind in the shirebut all such places will soon become islands under siege ,  if things go on as they are goingthe dark lord is putting forth all his strengthwhile his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire ,  `we must keep up our courageyou will soon be well ,  if i do not talk you to deathyou are in rivendell ,  and you need not worry about anything for the presentjust give me news of my friends ,  and tell me the end of the affair at the ford ,  as i keep on asking ,  and i shall be content for the presentafter that i shall have another sleep ,  i think ;  but i shan ' t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for methe colour had come back to his face ,  and his eyes were clear ,  and fully awake and awarehe was smiling ,  and there seemed to be little wrong with himbut to the wizard ' s eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were of transparency ,  about him ,  and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverletnot to evil ,  i thinkhe may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that canbut quite brief ,  mind you ,  and then you must sleep againthis is what happened ,  as far as i can gatherthe riders made straight for you ,  as soon as you fledthey did not need the guidance of their horses any longer :  you had become visible to them ,  being already on the threshold of their worldand also the ring drew themyour friends sprang aside ,  off the road ,  or they would have been ridden downthey knew that nothing could save you ,  if the white horse could notthe riders were too swift to overtake ,  and too many to opposeon foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine at onceclose to the ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted treesthere they hastily kindled fire ;  for glorfindel knew that a flood would come down ,  if the riders tried to cross ,  and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the riverthe moment the flood appeared ,  he rushed out ,  followed by aragorn and theothers with flaming brandscaught between fire and water ,  and seeing an elf - lord revealed in his wrath ,  they were dismayed ,  and their horses were stricken with madnessthree were carried away by the first assault of the flood ;  the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmedbut the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyedhowever ,  there is nothing more to fear from them at presentyour friends crossed after the flood had passed ;  and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank ,  with a broken sword under youthe horse was standing guard beside youyou were pale and cold ,  and they feared that you were dead ,  or worseelrond ' s folk met them ,  carrying you slowly towards rivendellas soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was releasedif i may say so ,  i added a few touches of my own :  you may not have noticed ,  but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders ;  and there were many rolling and grinding bouldersfor a moment i was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath ,  and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all awaythere is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the misty mountainsi thought i was drowning ,  with my friends and enemies and allbut now we are safesoon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the ford of bruinen ,  and you will all be there in places of honourthe ring is another :  you are the ring - bearerand you are the heir of bilbo ,  the ring - finderi wish he was here and could hear all about itit would have made him laugh ,  the cow jumped over the moonand the poor old trollfrodo was now safe in the last homely house east of the seathat house was ,  as bilbo had long ago reported ,  `a perfect house ,  whether you like food or sleep ,  or story - telling or singing ,  or just sitting and thinking best ,  or a pleasant mixture of them all 'merely to be there was a cure for weariness ,  fear ,  and sadnessas the evening drew on ,  frodo woke up again ,  and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep ,  but had a mind for food and drink ,  and probably for singing and story - telling afterwardshe got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had beenhe found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellentlylooking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered :  it looked remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shire ;  but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfullyat that moment there was a knock on the door ,  and sam came inhe ran to frodo and took his left hand ,  awkwardly and shylyhe stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily awayit has felt so cold through the long nightsbut glory and trumpetsgandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down ,  and i thought he was jokingalways a bit more to discover ,  and no knowing what you ' ll find round a cornerand elves ,  sirelves here ,  and elves theresome like kings ,  terrible and splendid ;  and some as merry as childrenand the music and the singing - not that i have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got herebut i ' m getting to know some of the ways of the placecome on ,  guide me round the cornershe found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking eastshadows had fallen in the valley below ,  but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far abovethe air was warmthe sound of running and falling water was loud ,  and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers ,  as if summer still lingered in elrond ' s gardensmake way for frodo ,  lord of the ringthe lord of the ring is not frodo ,  but the master of the dark tower of mordor ,  whose power is again stretching out over the worldwe are sitting in a fortressoutside it is getting darkbut it seems impossible ,  somehow ,  to feel gloomy or depressed in this placei feel i could sing ,  if i knew the right song for the occasionthe hall of elrond ' s house was filled with folk :  elves for the most part ,  though there were a few guests of other sortselrond ,  as was his custom ,  sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais ;  and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel ,  on the other side sat gandalffrodo looked at them in wonder ,  for he had never before seen elrond ,  of whom so many tales spoke ;  and as they sat upon his right hand and his left ,  glorfindel ,  and even gandalf ,  whom he thought he knew so well ,  were revealed as lords of dignity and powergandalf was shorter in stature than the other two ;  but his long white hair ,  his sweeping silver beard ,  and his broad shoulders ,  made him look like some wise king of ancient legendin his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fireglorfindel was tall and straight ;  his hair was of shining gold ,  his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy ;  his eyes were bright and keen ,  and his voice like music ;  on his brow sat wisdom ,  and in his hand was strengththe face of elrond was ageless ,  neither old nor young ,  though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowfulhis hair was dark as the shadows of twilight ,  and upon it was set a circlet of silver ;  his eyes were grey as a clear evening ,  and in them was a light like the light of starsvenerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters ,  and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strengthhe was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and menin the middle of the table ,  against the woven cloths upon the wall ,  there was a chair under a canopy ,  and there sat a lady fair to look upon ,  and so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond that frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindredyoung she was and yet not sothe braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost ,  her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth ,  and the light of stars was in her bright eyes ,  grey as a cloudless night ;  yet queenly she looked ,  and thought and knowledge were in her glance ,  as of one who has known many things that the years bringabove her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems ,  glittering white ;  but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silverso it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen ;  arwen ,  daughter of elrond ,  in whom it was said that the likeness of l˙thien had come on earth again ;  and she was called undûmiel ,  for she was the evenstar of her peoplelong she had been in the land of her mother ' s kin ,  in lûrien beyond the mountains ,  and was but lately returned to rivendell to her father ' s housebut her brothers ,  elladan and elrohir ,  were out upon errantry :  for they rode often far afield with the rangers of the north ,  forgetting never their mother ' s torment in the dens of the orcssuch loveliness in living thing frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind ;  and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at elrond ' s table among all these folk so high and fairthough he had a suitable chair ,  and was raised upon several cushions ,  he felt very small ,  and rather out of place ;  but that feeling quickly passedthe feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desireit was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbourshe looked first for his friendssam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master ,  but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honourfrodo could see him now ,  sitting with pippin and merry at the upper end of one of the side - tables close to the daishe could see no sign of stridernext to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance ,  richly dressedhis beard ,  very long and forked ,  was white ,  nearly as white as the snow - white cloth of his garmentshe wore a silver belt ,  and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamondsfrodo stopped eating to look at himthen he actually rose from his seat and bowedallow me to congratulate you on your recoverynothing like it has happened since bilbo came with usbut perhaps i should not inquire too closely ,  since elrond and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of thishe guessed that even in elrond ' s house the matter of the ring was not one for casual talk ;  and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a timemaster elrond will summon us all ere long ,  i believe ,  and then we shall all hear many thingsbut there is much else that may be toldfrodo learned that grimbeorn the old ,  son of beorn ,  was now the lord of many sturdy men ,  and to their land between the mountains and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to gothey are valiant men and keep open the high pass and the ford of carrockbut their tolls are high ,  '  he added with a shake of his head ;  `and like beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarvesstill ,  they are trusty ,  and that is much in these daysnowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dalethey are good folk ,  the bardingsthe grandson of bard the bowman rules them ,  brand son of bain son of bardhe is a strong king ,  and his realm now reaches far south and east of esgarothif you really wish to hear of us ,  i will tell you tidings gladlybut stop me when you are wearydwarves '  tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork ,  they sayhe was delighted to have found so polite a listener ;  for frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject ,  though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of beforehe was interested ,  however ,  to hear that d·in was still king under the mountain ,  and was now old  ( having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year )  ,  venerable ,  and fabulously richof the ten companions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were still with him :  dwalin ,  glûin ,  dori ,  nori ,  bifur ,  bofur ,  and bomburbombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table ,  and it took six young dwarves to lift hima shadow passed over glûin ' s facebut tonight let us speak of merrier thingssecrets are lostwe make good armour and keen swords ,  but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon cameonly in mining and building have we surpassed the old daysyou should see the waterways of dale ,  frodo ,  and the fountains ,  and the poolsyou should see the stone - paved roads of many coloursand the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees ;  and the terraces and towers upon the mountain ' s sidesthen you would see that we have not been idleelrond and arwen rose and went down the hall ,  and the company followed them in due orderthe doors were thrown open ,  and they went across a wide passage and through other doors ,  and came into a further hallin it were no tables ,  but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either sidefrodo found himself walking with gandalfbut except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet ,  and people come here who wish for peace ,  and thoughtthere is always a fire here ,  all the year round ,  but there is little other lightslowly the hall filled ,  and frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together ;  the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hairsuddenly he noticed ,  not far from the further end of the fire ,  a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillarbeside him on the ground was a drinking - cup and some breadfrodo wondered whether he was ill  ( if people were ever ill in rivendell )  ,  and had been unable to come to the feasthis head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast ,  and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his faceelrond went forward and stood beside the silent figurehe said ,  with a smilethen ,  turning to frodo ,  he beckoned to himi hoped you would manage itwell ,  wellso all this feasting is in your honour ,  i heari hope you enjoyed yourselfi have seen a good deal of youi have sat by your side with sam each daybut as for the feast` i don ' t go in for such things much nowand i had something else to doi do a lot of that nowadays ,  and this is the best place to do it in ,  as a rulewake up ,  indeedthere was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that frodo could seei was not asleepmaster elrondif you want to know ,  you have all come out from your feast too soon ,  and you have disturbed me - in the middle of making up a songi was stuck over a line or two ,  and was thinking about them ;  but now i don ' t suppose i shall ever get them rightthere will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my headi shall have to get my friend the d˙nadan to help mewhere is hein the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side ,  and sam came quickly and placed himself near themthey talked together in soft voices ,  oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about thembilbo had not much to say of himselfwhen he had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly ,  along the road or in the country on either side ;  but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendelli shan ' t travel againold balin had gone awaythen i came back here ,  and here i have beeni have done this and thati have written some more of my bookand ,  of course ,  i make up a few songsthey sing them occasionally :  just to please me ,  i think ;  for ,  of course ,  they aren ' t really good enough for rivendelland i listen and i thinktime doesn ' t seem to pass here :  it just isa remarkable place altogetheri heard about the ring ,  of coursegandalf has been here oftennot that he has told me a great deal ,  he has become closer than ever these last few yearsthe d˙nadan has told me morefancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbanceit is a pity that gandalf did not find out more sooneri could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much troublei have thought several times of going back to hobbiton for it ;  but i am getting old ,  and they would not let me :  gandalf and elrond ,  i meanthey seemed to think that the enemy was looking high and low for me ,  and would make mincemeat of me ,  if he caught me tottering about in the wildit would do no good to you or to others ,  if you tried to meddle with it againbut he said he was looking after you ,  so i let things bei am frightfully glad to see you safe and soundi should very much like just to peep at it againwhen he had dressed ,  frodo found that while he slept the ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain ,  light but strongslowly he drew it outbilbo put out his handbut frodo quickly drew back the ringto his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at bilbo ;  a shadow seemed to have fallen between them ,  and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping handshe felt a desire to strike himthe music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fellbilbo looked quickly at frodo ' s face and passed his hand across his eyesi am sorry :  sorry you have come in for this burden :  sorry about everythingdon ' t adventures ever have an endi suppose notsomeone else always has to carry on the storywell ,  it can ' t be helpedi wonder if it ' s any good trying to finish my bookbut don ' t let ' s worry about it now - let ' s have some real newstell me all about the shirethe light and music of rivendell was about him againbilbo smiled and laughed happilyevery item of news from the shire that frodo could tell - aided and corrected now and again by sam - was of the greatest interest to him ,  from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbitonthey were so deep in the doings of the four farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green clothfor many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smilesuddenly bilbo looked upbut i thought you knew enough elvish at least to know d˙n - udan :  man of the west ,  n˙menoreanbut this is not the time for lessonswhy weren ' t you at the feastthe lady arwen was thereelladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked - for ,  and they had tidings that i wished to hear at oncei want your help in something urgentelrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening ,  and i am stucklet ' s go off into a corner and polish it upfor sam had fallen asleephe was alone and felt rather forlorn` although all about him the folk of rivendell were gatheredbut those near him were silent ,  intent upon the music of the voices and the instrumentsand they gave no heed to anything elsefrodo began to listenat first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven - tongues ,  even though he understood them little` held him in a spell ,  as soon as he began to attend to themalmost it seemed that the words took shape ,  and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him ;  and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the worldthen the enchantment became more and more dreamlike ,  until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him ,  too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended ;  it became part of the throbbing air about him ,  and it drenched and drowned himswiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleepthere he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water ,  and then suddenly into a voiceit seemed to be the voice of bilbo chanting versesfaint at first and then clearer ran the wordse‰rendil was a mariner           that tarried in arvernien ;            he built a boat of timber felled           in nimbrethil to journey in ;            her sails he wove of silver fair ,            of silver were her lanterns made ,            her prow was fashioned like a swan ,            and light upon her banners laidin panoply of ancient kings ,            in chainèd rings he armoured him ;            his shining shield was scored with runes           to ward all wounds and harm from him ;            his bow was made of dragon - horn ,            his arrows shorn of ebony ,            of silver was his habergeon ,            his scabbard of chalcedony ;            his sword of steel was valiant ,            of adamant his helmet tall ,            an eagle - plume upon his crest ,            upon his breast an emeraldbeneath the moon and under star           he wandered far from northern strands ,            bewildered on enchanted ways           beyond the days of mortal landsfrom gnashing of the narrow ice           where shadow lies on frozen hills ,            from nether heats and burning waste           he turned in haste ,  and roving still           on starless waters far astray           at last he came to night of naught ,            and passed ,  and never sight he saw           of shining shore nor light he soughtthe winds of wrath came driving him ,            and blindly in the foam he fled           from west to east and errandless ,            unheralded he homeward spedthere flying elwing came to him ,            and flame was in the darkness lit ;            more bright than light of diamond           the fire upon her carcanetthe silmaril she bound on him           and crowned him with the living light           and dauntless then with burning brow           he turned his prow ;  and in the night           from otherworld beyond the sea           there strong and free a storm arose ,            a wind of power in tarmenel ;            by paths that seldom mortal goes           his boat it bore with biting breath           as might of death across the grey           and long - forsaken seas distressed :            from east to west he passed awaythrough evernight he back was borne           on black and roaring waves that ran           o ' er leagues unlit and foundered shores           that drowned before the days began ,            until he heard on strands of pearl           when ends the world the music long ,            where ever foaming billows roll           the yellow gold and jewels wanhe saw the mountain silent rise           where twilight lies upon the knees           of valinor ,  and eldamar           beheld afar beyond the seasa wanderer escaped from night           to haven white he came at last ,            to elvenhome the green and fair           where keen the air ,  where pale as glass           beneath the hill of ilmarin           a - glimmer in a valley sheer           the lamplit towers of tirion           are mirrored on the shadowmerehe tarried there from errantry ,            and melodies they taught to him ,            and sages old him marvels told ,            and harps of gold they brought to himthey clothed him then in elven - white ,            and seven lights before him sent ,            as through the calacirian           to hidden land forlorn he wenthe came unto the timeless halls           where shining fall the countless years ,            and endless reigns theelder king           in ilmarin on mountain sheer ;            and words unheard were spoken then           of folk of

with shining prow ;  no shaven oar           nor sail she bore on silver mast :            the silmaril as lantern light           and banner bright with living flame           to gleam thereon by elbereth           herself was set ,  who thither came           and wings immortal made for him ,            and laid on him undying doom ,            to sail the shoreless skies and come           behind the sun and light of moonfrom evereven ' s lofty hills           where softly silver fountains fall           his wings him bore ,  a wandering light ,            beyond the mighty mountain wallfrom world ' s end then he turned away           and yearned again to find afar           his home through shadows journeying ,            and burning as an island star           on high above the mists he came ,            a distant flame before the sun ,            a wonder ere the waking dawn           where grey the norland waters runand over middle - earth he passed           and heard at last the weeping sore           of women and of elven - maids           in elder days ,  in years of yoregut on him mighty doom was laid ,            till moon should fade ,  an orbèd star           to pass ,  and tarry never more           on hither shores where mortals are ;            for ever still a herald on           an errand that should never rest           to bear his shining lamp afar

regret as they passed out of the hall of fireeven as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in songa elbereth gilthoniel ,            silivren penna mìriel           o menel aglar

chair and the fire was on his face like summer - light upon the treesnear him sat the lady arwento his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her ;  his dark cloak was thrown back ,  and he seemed to be clad in elven - mail ,  and a star shone on his breastthey spoke together ,  and then suddenly it seemed to frodo that arwen turned towards him ,  and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his hearthe stood still enchanted ,  while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melodyit opened on to the gar dens and looked south across the ravine of the bruinenthere they sat for some while ,  looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep - climbing woods ,  and talking softlythey spoke no more of the small news of the shire far away ,  nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them ,  but of the fair things they had seen in the world together ,  of the elves ,  of the stars ,  of trees ,  and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woodsat last there came a knock on the doorgood night ,  frodobless me ,  but it has been good to see you againthere are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talki am getting very old ,  and i began to wonder if i should ever live to see your chapters of our storyi ' ll take a walk ,  i think ,  and look at the stars of elbereth in the gardenhe walked along the terraces above the loud - flowing bruinen and watched the pale ,  cool sun rise above the far mountains ,  and shine downslanting through the thin silver mist ;  the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering ,  and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bushsam walked beside him ,  saying nothingbut sniffing the air ,  and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the eastthe snow was white upon their peakson a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talkgood morningi should like to get into those pine - woods up therethere is much to hear and decide todayboth you and bilbo are wantedgandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found his friends the evening beforethe light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valleythe noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river - bedbirds were singing ,  and a wholesome peace lay on the landto frodo his dangerous flight ,  and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside ,  already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream ;  but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were graveelrond was there ,  and several others were seated in silence about himfrodo saw glorfindel and glûin ;  and in a corner alone strider was sitting ,  clad in his old travel - worn clothes againelrond drew frodo to a seat by his side ,  and presented him to the company ,  saying :       ' here ,  my friends is the hobbit ,  frodo son of drogofew have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgentthere was a younger dwarf at glûin ' s side :  his son gimlibeside glorfindel there were several other counsellors of elrond ' s household ,  of whom erestor was the chief ;  and with him was galdor ,  an elf from the grey havens who had come on an errand from cìrdan the shipwrightthere was also a strange elf clad in green and brown ,  legolas ,  a messenger from his father ,  thranduil ,  the king of the elves of northern mirkwoodand seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face ,  dark - haired and grey - eyed ,  proud and stern of glancehe was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback ;  and indeed though his garments were rich ,  and his cloak was lined with fur ,  they were stained with long travelhe had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set ;  his locks were shorn about his shoulderson a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his kneeshe gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonderhe arrived in the grey morning ,  and seeks for counseli have bidden him to be present ,  for here his questions will be answeredmuch was said of events in the world outside ,  especially in the south ,  and in the wide lands east of the mountainsof these things frodo had already heard many rumours ;  but the tale of glûin was new to him ,  and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentivelyit appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubledwhence it came we did not at first perceivewords began to be whispered in secret :  it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place ,  and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider worldsome spoke of moria :  the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue khazad - d˚m ;  and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to returnwonder of the northern worldtoo deep we delved there ,  and woke the nameless fearlong have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of durin fledbut now we spoke of it again with longing ,  and yet with dread ;  for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of khazad - d˚m for many lives of kings ,  save thrûr only ,  and he perishedat last ,  however ,  balin listened to the whispers ,  and resolved to go ;  and though d·in did not give leave willingly ,  he took with him ori and ”in and many of our folk ,  and they went away southfor a while we had news and it seemed good :  messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work begun therethen there was silence ,  and no word has ever come from moria sincethe lord sauron the great ,  so he said ,  wished for our friendshiprings he would give for it ,  such as he gave of oldand he asked urgently concerning hobbits ,  of what kind they were ,  and where they dweltand then his fell voice was lowered ,  and he would have sweetened it if he couldit is but a trifle that sauron fancies ,  and an earnest of your good willfind it ,  and three rings that the dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you ,  and the realm of moria shall be yours for everfind only news of the thief ,  whether he still lives and where ,  and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lordrefuse ,  and things will not seem so welldo you refusei must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloakwe needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit ;  for we knew already that the power that has re - entered mordor has not changed ,  and ever it betrayed us of oldtwice the messenger has returned ,  and has gone unansweredthe third and last time ,  so he says ,  is soon to come ,  before the ending of the yearalso we crave the advice of elrondfor the shadow grows and draws nearerwe discover that messengers have come also to king brand in dale ,  and that he is afraidwe fear that he may yieldalready war is gathering on his eastern bordersif we make no answer ,  the enemy may move men of his rule to assail king brand ,  and d·in alsothere is naught that you can do ,  other than to resist ,  with hope or without itbut you do not stand aloneyou will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western worldwhat shall we do with the ring ,  the least of rings ,  the trifle that sauron fanciesthat is the doom that we must deemcalled ,  i saythough i have not called you to me ,  strangers from distant landsyou have come and are here met ,  in this very nick of time ,  by chance as it may seemyet it is not sobelieve rather that it is so ordered that we ,  who sit here ,  and none others ,  must now find counsel for the peril of the worldand first ,  so that all may understand what is the peril ,  the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning even to this presentand i will begin that tale ,  though others shall end ita part of his tale was known to some there ,  but the full tale to none ,  and many eyes were turned t= elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the elven - smiths of eregion and their friendship with moria ,  and their eagerness for knowledge ,  by which sauron ensnared themfor in that time he was not yet evil to behold ,  and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft ,  whereas he learned all their secrets ,  and betrayed them ,  and forged secretly in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their masterbut celebrimbor was aware of him ,  and hid the three which he had made ;  and there was war ,  and the land was laid waste ,  and the gate of moria was shutthen through all the years that followed he traced the ring ;  but since that history is elsewhere recounted ,  even as elrond himself set it down in his books of lore ,  it is not here recalledfor it is a long tale ,  full of deeds great and terrible ,  and briefly though elrond spoke ,  the sun rode up the sky ,  and the morning was passing ere he ceasedof n˙menor he spoke ,  its glory and its fall ,  and the return of the kings of men to middle - earth out of the deeps of the sea ,  borne upon the wings of stormthen elendil the tall and his mighty sons ,  isildur and an·rion ,  became great lords ;  and the north - realm they made in arnor ,  and the south - realm in gondor above the mouths of anduinbut sauron of mordor assailed them ,  and they made the last alliance of elves and men ,  and the hosts of gil - galad and elendil were mustered in arnorthereupon elrond paused a while and sighedand yet not so many ,  nor so fair ,  as when thangorodrim was broken ,  and the elves deemed that evil was ended for ever ,  and it was not soe‰rendil was my sire ,  who was born in gondolin before its fall ;  and my mother was elwing ,  daughter of dior ,  son of l˙thien of doriathi have seen three ages in the west of the world ,  and many defeats ,  and many fruitless victoriesi was at the battle of dagorlad before the black gate of mordor ,  where we had the mastery :  for the spear of gil - galad and the sword of elendil ,  aiglos and narsil ,  none could withstandi beheld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin ,  where gil - galad died ,  and elendil fell ,  and narsil broke beneath him ;  but sauron himself was overthrown ,  and isildur cut the ring from his hand with the hilt - shard of his father ' s sword ,  and took it for his owni have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name ;  but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realmisildur took itthat is tidings indeedyes ,  '  said elrondit should have been cast then into orodruin ' s fire nigh at hand where it was madebut few marked what isildur didhe alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest ;  and by gil - galad only cìrdan stood ,  and ibut isildur would not listen to our counselbut soon he was betrayed by it to his death ;  and so it is named in the north isildur ' s baneyet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen himsmall wonder it is that you have not heard them ,  boromirfrom the ruin of the gladden fields ,  where isildur perished ,  three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wanderingone of these was ohtar ,  the esquire of isildur ,  who bore the shards of the sword of elendil ;  and he brought them to valandil ,  the heir of isildur ,  who being but a child had remained here in rivendellbut narsil was broken and its light extinguished ,  and it has not yet been forged againnot wholly so ,  yet it did not achieve its endsauron was diminished ,  but not destroyedhis ring was lost but not unmadethe dark tower was broken ,  but its foundations were not removed ;  for they were made with the power of the ring ,  and while it remains they will enduremany elves and many mighty men ,  and many of their friendshad perished in the waran·rion was slain ,  and isildur was slain ;  and gil - galad and elendil were no morenever again shall there be any such league of elves and men ;  for men multiply and the firstborn decrease ,  and the two kindreds are estrangedand ever since that day the race of n˙menor has decayed ,  and the span of their years has lessenedmen call it deadmen ' s dike ,  and they fear to tread therefor the folk of arnor dwindled ,  and their foes devoured them ,  and their lordship passed ,  leaving only green mounds in the grassy hillshigh towers that people built ,  and strong placesand havens of many ships ;  and the winged crown of the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tonguestheir chief city was osgiliath ,  citadel of the starsthrough the midst of which the river flowedand minas ithil they built ,  tower of the rising moon ,  eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow ;  and westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made ,  tower of the setting sunthere in the courts of the king grew a white tree ,  from the seed of that tree which isildur brought over the deep waters ,  and the seed of that tree before came from eressîa ,  and before that out of the uttermost west in the day before days when the world was youngthen the watch upon the walls of mordor slept ,  and dark things crept back to gorgorothand on a time evil things came forth ,  and they took minas ithil and abode in it ,  and they made it into a place of dread ;  and it is called minas morgul ,  the tower of sorcerythen minas anor was named anew minas tirith ,  the tower of guard ;  and these two cities were ever at war ,  but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walkedbut the lords of minas tirith still fight on ,  defying our enemies ,  keeping the passage of the river from argonath to the seaand now that part of the tale that i shall tell is drawn to its closefor in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge ,  and the three were released from its dominionbut now in this latter day they are in peril once more ,  for to our sorrow the one has been foundothers shall speak of its finding ,  for in that i played small partgive me leave ,  master elrond ,  said he ,  first to say more of gondor ;  for verily from the land of gondor i am comeand it would be well for all to know what passes therefor few ,  i deem ,  know of our deeds ,  and therefore guess little of their peril ,  if we should fail at lastby our valour the wild folk of the east are still restrained ,  and the terror of morgul kept at bay ;  and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us ,  bulwark of the westbut if the passages of the river should be won ,  what thenthe nameless enemy has arisen againsmoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doomthe power of the black land grows and we are hard besetwhen the enemy returned our folk were driven from ithilien ,  our fair domain east of the river ,  though we kept a foothold there and strength of armsbut this very year ,  in the days of june ,  sudden war came upon us out of mordor ,  and we were swept awaywe were outnumbered ,  for mordor has allied itself with the easterlings and the cruel haradrim ;  but it was not by numbers that we were defeateda power was there that we have not felt beforewherever he came a madness filled our foes ,  but fear fell on our boldest ,  so that horse and man gave way and fledonly a remnant of our eastern force came back ,  destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliathfour only were saved by swimming :  my brother and myself and two othersbut still we fight on ,  holding all the west shores of anduin ;  and those who shelter behind us give us praise ,  if ever they hear our name :  much praise but little helponly from rohan now will any men ride to us when we callbut i do not seek allies in warthe might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons ,  it is saidi come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard wordsfor on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep ;  and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again ,  and once to methere shall be shown a token            that doom is near at hand ,            for isildur ' s bane shall waken ,             and the halfling forth shall standof these words we could understand little ,  and we spoke to our father ,  denethor ,  lord of minas tirith ,  wise in the lore of gondorthis only would he say ,  that imladris was of old the name among the elves of a far northern dale ,  where elrond the halfelven dwelt ,  greatest of lore - masterstherefore my brother ,  seeing how desperate was our need ,  was eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris ;  but since the way was full of doubt and danger ,  i took the journey upon myselfloth was my father to give me leave ,  and long have i wandered by roads forgotten ,  seeking the house of elrond ,  of which many had heard ,  but few knew where it layhe cast his sword upon the table that stood before elrond ,  and the blade was in two pieceshe is the chief of the d˙nedain in the north ,  and few are now left of that folkhold it up ,  and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddlehe was shaken by a sudden shame and fear ;  and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring ,  and a loathing of its touchhe wished he was far awaythe ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling handboromir ' s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thingbut why then should we seek a broken swordfor the sword that was broken is the sword of elendil that broke beneath him when he fellit has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost ;  for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the ring ,  isildur ' s bane ,  was foundnow you have seen the sword that you have sought ,  what would you askdo you wish for the house of elendil to return to the land of gondorfrodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his sideevidently he was annoyed on his friend ' s behalfstanding suddenly up he burst out :           all that is gold does not glitter ,             not all those who wander are lost ;            the old that is strong does not wither ,             deep roots are not reached by the frostfrom the ashes a fire shall be woken ,             a light from the shadows shall spring ;            renewed shall be blade that was broken :             the crownless again shall be kingif that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear ,  you had best listen to iti almost wish that my adventures were not over ,  and that i could go with him when his day comesi am but the heir of isildur ,  not isildur himselfi have had a hard life and a long ;  and the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a small part in the count of my journeysi have crossed many mountains and many rivers ,  and trodden many plains ,  even into the far countries of rh˚n and harad where the stars are strangefor here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generationsour days have darkened ,  and we have dwindled ;  but ever the sword has passed to a new keeperand this i will say to you ,  boromir ,  ere i endlonely men are we ,  rangers of the wild ,  hunters ñ but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy ;  for they are found in many places ,  not in mordor onlymany evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stayyou know little of the lands beyond your boundspeace and freedom ,  do you saythe north would have known them little but for usfear would have destroyed thembut when dark things come from the houseless hills ,  or creep from sunless woods ,  they fly from uswhat roads would any dare to tread ,  what safety would there be in quiet lands ,  or in the homes of simple men at night ,  if the d˙nedain were asleep ,  or were all gone into the gravetravellers scowl at us ,  and countrymen give us scornful namesyet we would not have it otherwiseif simple folk are free from care and fear ,  simple they will be ,  and we must be secret to keep them sothat has been the task of my kindred ,  while the years have lengthened and the grass has growna new hour comesisildur ' s bane is foundbattle is at handthe sword shall be reforgedi will come to minas tirithhow do the wise know that this ring is hisand how has it passed down the years ,  until it is brought hither by so strange a messengertell us your taleand if you have not yet cast your story into verse ,  you may tell it in plain wordsthe briefer ,  the sooner shall you be refreshedbut i will now tell the true story ,  and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise '  ñ he looked sidelong at glûin ñ `i ask them to forget it and forgive mei only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days ,  and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on mebut perhaps i understand things a little better nowanyway ,  this is what happenedhe did not omit a single riddlehe would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the shire ,  if he had been allowed ;  but elrond raised his handfor the moment it suffices to know that the ring passed to frodo ,  your heirlet him now speakevery step of his journey from hobbiton to the ford of bruinen was questioned and considered ,  and everything that he could recall concerning the black riders was examinedat last he sat down againi tried to make a few notes ,  but we shall have to go over it all again together some time ,  if i am to write it upthere are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got herei still want to know a good deal ,  especially about gandalfbut may we not hear the proofsand i would ask this alsowhat of sarumanhe is learned in the lore of the rings ,  yet he is not among uswhat is his counsel - if he knows the things that we have heardbut these things it is the part of gandalf to make clear ;  and i call upon him last ,  for it is the place of honour ,  and in all this matter he has been the chiefyet it is a ringthe nine the nazg˚l keepthe seven are taken or destroyedwhat then is this one that he desires so muchbut the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at lastyet too slowlyfor the enemy has been close behind ,  closer even than i fearedand well is it that not until this year ,  this very summer ,  as it seems ,  did he learn the full truthsome ,  too ,  will remember also that saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him ,  and for long we watched him onlyyet at last ,  as his shadow grew ,  saruman yielded ,  and the council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of mirkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of this ring :  a strange chance ,  if chance it wassauron also had watched us ,  and had long prepared against our stroke ,  governing mordor from afar through minas morgul ,  where his nine servants dwelt ,  until all was readythen he gave way before us ,  but only feigned to flee ,  and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himselfthen for the last time the council met ;  for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the onewe feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing ofbut saruman said nay ,  and repeated what he had said to us before :  that the one would never again be found in middle - earthbut what was lost may yet be found ,  he thinkshis hope will cheat himhave i not earnestly studied this matterinto anduin the great it fell ;  and long ago ,  while sauron slept ,  it was rolled down the river to the seathere let it lie until the endso i set a watch for him ,  guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasurehe came ,  but he escaped and was not foundand then alasi let the matter rest ,  watching and waiting only ,  as we have too often donewhence came the hobbit ' s ringwhat ,  if my fear was true ,  should be done with itthose things i must decidebut i spoke yet of my dread to none ,  knowing the peril of an untimely whisper ,  if it went astrayin all the long wars with the dark tower treason has ever been our greatest foesoon i became aware that spies of many sorts ,  even beasts and birds ,  were gathered round the shire ,  and my fear grewi called for the help of the d˙nedain ,  and their watch was doubled ;  and i opened my heart to aragorn ,  the heir of isildurtoo late though it may seemand since it seemed fit that isildur ' s heir should labour to repair isildur ' s fault ,  i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless searchand then in my despair i thought again of a test that might make the finding of gollum unneededthe ring itself might tell if it were the onethe memory of words at the council came back to me :  words of saruman ,  half - heeded at the timei heard them now clearly in my heartnot so the oneit was round and unadorned ,  as it were one of the lesser rings ;  but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled ,  maybe ,  could still see and readwho now would knowand sarumanbut great though his lore may be ,  it must have a sourcewhat hand save sauron ' s ever held this thing ,  ere it was lostthe hand of isildur alonein former days the members of my order had been well received there ,  but saruman most of alloften he had been for long the guest of the lords of the cityless welcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old ,  and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and booksbut unless you have more skill even than saruman ,  who has studied here long ,  you will find naught that is not well known to me ,  who am master of the lore of this cityand yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read ,  even of the lore - masters ,  for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later menand boromir ,  there lies in minas tirith still ,  unread ,  i guess ,  by any save saruman and myself since the kings failed ,  a scroll that isildur made himselffor isildur did not march away straight from the war in mordor ,  as some have told the talein that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory of his brotherfor this scroll concerns the ring ,  and thus wrote isildur therein :      the great ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the north kingdom ;  but records of it shall be left in gondor ,  where also dwell the heirs of elendil ,  lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dimit was hot when i first took it ,  hot as a glede ,  and my hand was scorched ,  so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of ityet even as i write it is cooled ,  and it seemeth to shrink ,  though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shapealready the writing upon it ,  which at first was as clear as red flame ,  fadeth and is now only barely to be readit is fashioned in an elven - script of eregion ,  for they have no letters in mordor for such subtle work ;  but the language is unknown to mei deem it to be a tongue of the black land ,  since it is foul and uncouthwhat evil it saith i do not know ;  but i trace here a copy of it ,  lest it fade beyond recallthe ring misseth ,  maybe ,  the heat of sauron ' s hand ,  which was black and yet burned like fire ,  and so gil - galad was destroyed ;  and maybe were the gold made hot again ,  the writing would be refreshedbut for my part i will risk no hurt to this thing :  of all the works of sauron the only fairit is precious to me ,  though i buy it with great painfor the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed ,  in the tongue of mordor and the servants of the towerand what was said therein was already knownfor in the day that sauron first put on the one ,  celebrimbor ,  maker of the three ,  was aware of him ,  and from afar he heard him speak these words ,  and so his evil purposes were revealedtherefore i went first to meet him and hear his taleinto what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guessi ,  too ,  despaired at last ,  and i began my homeward journeyand then ,  by fortune ,  i came suddenly on what i sought :  the marks of soft feet beside a muddy poolbut now the trail was fresh and swift ,  and it led not to mordor but awayalong the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it ,  and then i had himlurking by a stagnant mere ,  peering in the water as the dark eve fell ,  i caught him ,  gollumhe was covered with green slimehe will never love me ,  i fear ;  for he bit me ,  and i was not gentlenothing more did i ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teethi deemed it the worst part of all my journey ,  the road back ,  watching him day and night ,  making him walk before me with a halter on his neck ,  gagged ,  until he was tamed by lack of drink and food ,  driving him ever towards mirkwoodi brought him there at last and gave him to the elves ,  for we had agreed that this should be done ;  and i was glad to be rid of his company ,  for he stankfor my part i hope never to look upon him again ;  but gandalf came and endured long speech with himfor one thing ,  the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for the first time ;  but that mattered little ,  since i had already guessed itbut i learned then first that gollum ' s ring came out of the great river nigh to the gladden fieldsand i learned also that he had possessed it longmany lives of his small kindthe power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span ;  but that power only the great rings wieldupon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft ,  round and unadorned ,  the letters that isildur reported may still be read ,  if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a whilethat i have done ,  and this i have read :                  ash nazg durbatul˚k ,  ash nazg gimbatul ,  ash nazg thrakatul˚k agh burzum - ishi krimpatulsuddenly it became menacing ,  powerful ,  harsh as stonea shadow seemed to pass over the high sun ,  and the porch for a moment grew darkall trembled ,  and the elves stopped their earsfor if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the west ,  then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise have declared :  the treasure of the enemy ,  fraught with all his malice ;  and in it lies a great part of his strength of oldout of the black years come the words that the smiths of eregion heard ,  and knew that they had been betrayed :                  one ring to rule them all ,  one ring to find them ,  one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themhe was loth to speak and his tale was unclear ,  but it is beyond all doubt that he went to mordor ,  and there all that he knew was forced from himthus the enemy knows now that the one is found ,  that it was long in the shire ;  and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door ,  he soon will know ,  already he may know ,  even as i speak ,  that we have it heresmall ,  but great in mischiefwhat became of himto what doom did you put himthere is no doubt that he was tormented ,  and the fear of sauron lies black on his heartstill i for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful elves of mirkwoodhis malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and witheredhe could work much mischief still ,  if he were freeand i do not doubt that he was allowed to leave mordor on some evil errandthey are not good ,  but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this companysmèagol ,  who is now called gollum ,  has escapedwe shall all rue it bitterly ,  i fearhow came the folk of thranduil to fail in their trustand we fear that the prisoner had aid from others ,  and that more is known of our doings than we could wishwe guarded this creature day and night ,  at gandalf ' s bidding ,  much though we wearied of the taskbut gandalf bade us hope still for his cure ,  and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth ,  where he would fall back into his old black thoughtsthat was a regrettable misunderstanding ,  long set rightif all the grievances that stand between elves and dwarves are to be brought up here ,  we may as well abandon this counciloften we let him mount up to the highest branches ,  until he felt the free wind ;  but we set a guard at the tree ' s footone day he refused to come down ,  and the guards had no mind to climb after him :  he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands ;  so they sat by the tree far into the nightwe drove them off after some time ;  they were many and fierce ,  but they came from over the mountains ,  and were unused to the woodswhen the battle was over ,  we found that gollum was gone ,  and his guards were slain or takenit then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue ,  and that he knew of it beforehandhow that was contrived we cannot guess ;  but gollum is cunning ,  and the spies of the enemy are manythe dark things that were driven out in the year of the dragon ' s fall have returned in greater numbers ,  and mirkwood is again an evil place ,  save where our realm is maintainedwe came on his trail among those of many orcs ,  and it plunged deep into the forest ,  going southbut ere long it escaped our skill ,  and we dared not continue the hunt ;  for we were drawing nigh to dol guldur ,  and that is still a very evil place ;  we do not go that wayhe must do what he willbut he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseenwhat of sarumanwhat are his counsels to us in this needthis tale i must tell in full ,  for only elrond has heard it yet ,  and that in brief ,  but it will bear on all that we must resolveit is the last chapter in the tale of the ring ,  so far as it has yet gonethere messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in gondor ,  and when i heard of the black shadow a chill smote my heartbut i found nothing save a few fugitives from the south ;  yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speaki turned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway ;  and not far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside himit was radagast the brown ,  who at one time dwelt at rhosgobel ,  near the borders of mirkwoodhe is one of my order ,  but i had not seen him for many a yearbut i am a stranger in these partsall i knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of shireyou are near the borders of the shire nowand what do you want with meit must be pressingyou were never a traveller ,  unless driven by great needthey have crossed the river secretly and are moving westwardthey have taken the guise of riders in blackfor even the wise might fear to withstand the nine ,  when they are gathered together under their fell chieftaina great king and sorcerer he was of old ,  and now he wields a deadly fearfor saruman the white is the greatest of my orderradagast is ,  of course ,  a worthy wizard ,  a master of shapes and changes of hue ;  and he has much lore of herbs and beasts ,  and birds are especially his friendsbut saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy himself ,  and thus we have often been able to forestall himit was by the devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldurit might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the ninei was told to find you before midsummer ,  and that is now hereeven if you set out from this spot ,  you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seeki myself shall turn back at oncesend out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friendstell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to saruman and gandalflet messages be sent to orthanci had ridden very far already that day ,  and i was as weary as my horse ;  and i needed to consider mattersi stayed the night in bree ,  and decided that i had no time to return to the shirenever did i make a greater mistakei rode away at dawn ;  and i came at long last to the dwelling of sarumanthat is far south in isengard ,  in the end of the misty mountains ,  not far from the gap of rohanand boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the northmost foothills of ered nimrais ,  the white mountains of his homebut isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall ,  and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called orthancit was not made by saruman ,  but by the men of n˙menor long ago ;  and it is very tall and has many secrets ;  yet it looks not to be a work of craftit cannot be reached save by passing the circle of isengard ;  and in that circle there is only one gatebut the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that saruman awaited mei rode under the arch ,  and the gate closed silently behind me ,  and suddenly i was afraid ,  though i knew no reason for ithe wore a ring on his fingerit has seldom been heard of that gandalf the grey sought for aid ,  one so cunning and so wise ,  wandering about the lands ,  and concerning himself in every business ,  whether it belongs to him or noti wonder ,  have you concealed from me ,  the head of the council ,  a matter of greatest importwhat brings you now from your lurking - place in the shireso radagast said to meradagast the simpleradagast the foolyet he had just the wit to play the part that i set himfor you have come ,  and that was all the purpose of my messageand here you will stay ,  gandalf the grey ,  and rest from journeysfor i am saruman the wise ,  saruman ring - maker ,  saruman of many coloursand if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewilderedwhite cloth may be dyedthe white page can be overwritten ;  and the white light can be brokenthe middle days are passingthe younger days are beginningthe time of the elves is over ,  but our time is at hand :  the world of men ,  which we must rulebut we must have power ,  power to order all things as we will ,  for that good which only the wise can seea new power is risingagainst it the old allies and policies will not avail us at allthere is no hope left in elves or dying n˙menorthis then is one choice before youwe may join with that powerit would be wise ,  gandalfthere is hope that wayits victory is at hand ;  and there will be rich reward for those that aided itas the power grows ,  its proved friends will also grow ;  and the wise ,  such as you and i ,  may with patience come at last to direct its courses ,  to control itwe can bide our time ,  we can keep our thoughts in our hearts ,  deploring maybe evils done by the way ,  but approving the high and ultimate purpose :  knowledge ,  rule ,  order ;  all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish ,  hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friendsthere need not be ,  there would not be ,  any real change in our designs ,  only in our meansi cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my earsnot if some better way can be contrivedthe ruling ringif we could command that ,  then the power would pass to usthat is in truth why i brought you herefor i have many eyes in my service ,  and i believe that you know where this precious thing now liesis it not soor why do the nine ask for the shire ,  and what is your business therebut i would not give it ,  nay ,  i would not give even news of it to you ,  now that i learn your mindyou were head of the council ,  but you have unmasked yourself at lastwell ,  the choices are ,  it seems ,  to submit to sauron ,  or to yourselfi will take neitherhave you others to offerand so saving yourself much trouble and painthe third choice is to stay here ,  until the endi may find means to persuade youor until it is found in your despite ,  and the ruler has time to turn to lighter matters :  to devise ,  say ,  a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the greyhe laughed at me ,  for my words were empty ,  and he knew itthere is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps ,  and the valley below seems far awayi looked on it and saw that ,  whereas it had once been green and fair ,  it was now filled with pits and forgeswolves and orcs were housed in isengard ,  for saruman was mustering a great force on his own account ,  in rivalry of sauron and not in his service yetover all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of orthanci stood alone on an island in the clouds ;  and i had no chance of escape ,  and my days were bitteri was pierced with cold ,  and i had but little room in which to pace to and fro ,  brooding on the coming of the riders to the northlong ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistakenfear was ever in my heart for my friends in the shire ;  but still i had some hopei hoped that frodo had set forth at once ,  as my letter had urged ,  and that he had reached rivendell before the deadly pursuit beganand both my fear and my hope proved ill - foundedfor my hope was founded on a fat man in bree ;  and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauronbut fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer ;  and the power of sauron is still less than fear makes itbut in the circle of isengard ,  trapped and alone ,  it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far awaythe moon shone in your hairi had quite forgotten itit came some time ago ;  after i left the shire ,  i thinki was in an evil plightand those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in such need ,  and do not bear such misfortune wellgandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spider ' s treacherous webyet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak threadyet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meetingif i had ,  i should never have gone to isengard ,  or i should have gone more warilyso saruman guessed ,  and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messengerit would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest radagast to treacheryhe sought me in good faith ,  and so persuaded mefor radagast knew no reason why he should not do as i asked ;  and he rode away towards mirkwood where he had many friends of oldand the eagles of the mountains went far and wide ,  and they saw many things :  the gathering of wolves and the mustering of orcs ;  and the nine riders going hither and thither in the lands ;  and they heard news of the escape of gollumand they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to methen i spoke to him and he bore me away ,  before saruman was awarei was far from isengard ,  ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue mei was sent to bear tidings not burdensbut if saruman has become evil ,  as you say ,  then their doom cannot be long delayedthe rest must be more briefin rohan i found evil already at work :  the lies of saruman ;  and the king of the land would not listen to my warningshe bade me take a horse and be gone ;  and i chose one much to my likingbut little to hisi took the best horse in his land ,  and i have never seen the like of himit was not so when last i was in that landi know the men of rohan ;  true and valiant ,  our allies ,  dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long agorohan is besetwho knows what you will find there ,  if ever you returnthey love their horses next to their kinand not without reason ,  for the horses of the riddermark come from the fields of the north ,  far from the shadowand their race ,  as that of their masters ,  is descended from the free days of oldthe horses of the nine cannot vie with him ;  tireless ,  swift as the flowing windshadowfax they called himby day his coat glistens like silver ;  and by night it is like a shade ,  and he passes unseenlight is his footfallnever before had any man mounted him ,  but i took him and i tamed him ,  and so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire when frodo was on the barrow - downs ,  though i set out from rohan only when he set out from hobbitonever as i came north i heard tidings of the riders ,  and though i gained on them day by day ,  they were ever before methey had divided their forces ,  i learned :  some remained on the eastern borders ,  not far from the greenwayand some invaded the shire from the southi came to hobbiton and frodo had gone ;  but i had words with old gamgeemany words and few to the pointhe had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of bag endthen i rode on in feari came to buckland and found it in uproar ,  as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a sticki came to the house at crickhollow ,  and it was broken open and empty ;  but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been frodo ' sthen for a while hope left me ,  and i did not wait to gather news ,  or i might have been comforted ;  but i rode on the trail of the ridersit was hard to follow ,  for it went many ways ,  and i was at a lossbut it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards bree ;  and that way i went ,  for i thought of words that might be said to the innkeeperi will roast the old fool over a slow fireso overjoyed was i by the news that i got out of him ,  when he stopped quaking ,  that i embraced the old fellowhow it happened i could not then guess ,  but i learned that you had been in bree the night before ,  and had gone off that morning with striderthey behaved very queer all the time they were here :  wilful ,  you might saythrice worthy and beloved barlimanmay your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven yearsbut in the night we heard morefive at least came from the west ,  and they threw down the gates and passed through bree like a howling wind ;  and the bree - folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the worldi got up before dawn and went after themtheir captain remained in secret away south of bree ,  while two rode ahead through the village ,  and four more invaded the shirebut when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow ,  they returned to their captain with tidings ,  and so left the road unguarded for a while ,  except by their spiesthe captain then sent some eastward straight across country ,  and he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wraththey drew away from me ,  for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the sun was in the skybut they closed round at night ,  and i was besieged on the hill - top ,  in the old ring of amon s˚li was hard put to it indeed :  such light and flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war - beacons of oldi could not hope to do moreit was impossible to find you ,  frodo ,  in the wilderness ,  and it would have been folly to try with all the nine at my heelsso i had to trust to aragornbut i hoped to draw some of them off ,  and yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out helpfour riders did indeed follow me ,  but they turned back after a while and made for the ford ,  it seemsthat helped a little ,  for there were only five ,  not nine ,  when your camp was attackedit took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop ,  for i could not ride among the rocks of the troll - fells ,  and shadowfax departedi sent him back to his master ;  but a great friendship has grown between us ,  and if i have need he will come at my callbut so it was that i came to rivendell only three days before the ring ,  and news of its peril had already been brought here - which proved well indeedmay elrond and the others forgive the length of itbut such a thing has not happened before ,  that gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promisedan account to the ring - bearer of so strange an event was required ,  i thinkhere we all are ,  and here is the ringbut we have not yet come any nearer to our purposewhat shall we do with itat last elrond spoke againit is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the enemy ,  for good or for illbut such falls and betrayals ,  alas ,  have happened beforeof the tales that we have heard this day the tale of frodo was most strange to mei have known few hobbits ,  save bilbo here ;  and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as i had thought himthe world has changed much since i last was on the westward roadstime was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the shire to dunland west of isengardin those lands i journeyed once ,  and many things wild and strange i knewbut i had forgotten bombadil ,  if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago ,  and even then was older than the oldthat was not then his nameiarwain ben - adar we called him ,  oldest and fatherlessbut many another name he has since been given by other folk :  forn by the dwarves ,  orald by northern men ,  and other names besidehe is a strange creature ,  but maybe i should have summoned him to our councilhe is his own masterbut he cannot alter the ring itself ,  nor break its power over othersand now he is withdrawn into a little land ,  within bounds that he has set ,  though none can see them ,  waiting perhaps for a change of days ,  and he will not step beyond themhe might do so ,  if all the free folk of the world begged him ,  but he would not understand the needand if he were given the ring ,  he would soon forget it ,  or most likely throw it awaysuch things have no hold on his mindhe would be a most unsafe guardian ;  and that alone is answer enoughhe is far awaywe could not now take it back to him ,  unguessed ,  unmarked by any spyand even if we could ,  soon or late the lord of the rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards itcould that power be defied by bombadil alonei think noti think that in the end ,  if all else is conquered ,  bombadil will fall ,  last as he was first ;  and then night will comepower to defy our enemy is not in him ,  unless such power is in the earth itselfand yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hillswhat power still remains lies with us ,  here in imladris ,  or with cirdan at the havens ,  or in lûrienbut have they the strength ,  have we here the strength to withstand the enemy ,  the coming of sauron at the last ,  when all else is overthrownfor it is clear now that even at the council his feet were already on a crooked pathhe knew that the ring was not lost for ever ,  but wished us to think so ;  for he began to lust for it for himselfyet oft in lies truth is hidden :  in the sea it would be safeand it is not our part here to take thought only for a season ,  or for a few lives of men ,  or for a passing age of the worldwe should seek a final end of this menace ,  even if we do not hope to make onemy heart tells me that sauron will expect us to take the western way ,  when he learns what has befallenhe soon willthe nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite ,  ere they find new steeds and swifteronly the waning might of gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts into the north ;  and if he comes ,  assailing the white towers and the havens ,  hereafter the elves may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of middle - earthbut gondor stands ,  and even the end of its strength is still very strongbut both are beyond our powerwho will read this riddle for usbut it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must takethe westward road seems easiesttherefore it must be shunnedit will be watchedtoo often the elves have fled that waynow at this last we must take a hard road ,  a road unforeseenthere lies our hope ,  if hope it beto walk into peril - to mordorwe must send the ring to the firefrodo ,  even in that fair house ,  looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters ,  felt a dead darkness in his heartboromir stirred ,  and frodo looked at himhe was fingering his great horn and frowningat length he spokewhy do you speak ever of hiding and destroyingwhy should we not think that the great ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of needwielding it the free lords of the free may surely defeat the enemythat is what he most fears ,  i deemvalour needs first strength ,  and then a weaponlet the ring be your weapon ,  if it has such power as you saytake it and go forth to victorythat we now know too wellit belongs to sauron and was made by him alone ,  and is altogether evilits strength ,  boromir ,  is too great for anyone to wield at will ,  save only those who have already a great power of their ownbut for them it holds an even deadlier perilthe very desire of it corrupts the heartconsider sarumanif any of the wise should with this ring overthrow the lord of mordor ,  using his own arts ,  he would then set himself on sauron ' s throne ,  and yet another dark lord would appearand that is another reason why the ring should be destroyed :  as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the wisefor nothing is evil in the beginningeven sauron was not soi fear to take the ring to hide iti will not take the ring to wield itboromir looked at them doubtfully ,  but he bowed his headand at the least ,  while the wise ones guard this ring ,  we will fight onmayhap the sword - that - was - broken may still stem the tide ñ if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only ,  but the sinews of the kings of menit would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they haveanduin the great flows past many shores ,  ere it comes to argonath and the gates of gondorother rings there may be ,  less treacherous ,  that might be used in our needthe seven are lost to us ñ if balin has not found the ring of thrûr which was the last ;  naught has been heard of it since thrûr perished in moriaindeed i may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that balin went awayit was taken with torment from thr·in in the dungeons of dol gulduri came too latebut still there are the threewhat of the three rings of the elvesvery mighty rings ,  it is saiddo not the elf - lords keep themyet they too were made by the dark lord long agoare they idlei see elf - lords herewill they not saybut of them it is not permitted to speakso much only in this hour of doubt i may now saythey are not idlebut they were not made as weapons of war or conquest :  that is not their powerthose who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth ,  but understanding ,  making ,  and healing ,  to preserve all things unstainedthese things the elves of middle - earth have in some measure gained ,  though with sorrowbut all that has been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their undoing ,  and their minds and hearts will become revealed to sauron ,  if he regains the oneit would be better if the three had never beenthat is his purposebut maybe when the one has gone ,  the three will fail ,  and many fair things will fade and be forgottenthat is my beliefwhat strength have we for the finding of the fire in which it was madethat is the path of despairof folly i would say ,  if the long wisdom of elrond did not forbid meit is wisdom to recognize necessity ,  when all other courses have been weighed ,  though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hopewell ,  let folly be our cloak ,  a veil before the eyes of the enemyfor he is very wise ,  and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malicebut the only measure that he knows is desire ,  desire for power ;  and so he judges all heartsinto his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it ,  that having the ring we may seek to destroy itif we seek this ,  we shall put him out of reckoningand neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon itthis quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strongyet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world :  small hands do them because they must ,  while the eyes of the great are elsewhereit is plain enough what you are pointing atbilbo the silly hobbit started this affair ,  and bilbo had better finish it ,  or himselfi was very comfortable here ,  and getting on with my bookif you want to know ,  i am just writing an ending for iti had thought of putting :  and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his daysit is a good ending ,  and none the worse for having been used beforenow i shall have to alter that :  it does not look like coming true ;  and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters ,  if i live to write themit is a frightful nuisancewhen ought i to startonly glûin smiled ,  but his smile came from old memoriesbut you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any ,  and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any heroyou need not bowthough the word was meant ,  and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offerbut one beyond your strength ,  bilboyou cannot take this thing backit has passed onif you need my advice any longer ,  i should say that your part is ended ,  unless as a recorderfinish your book ,  and leave the ending unalteredthere is still hope for itbut get ready to write a sequel ,  when they come backstill ,  i don ' t suppose i have the strength or luck left to deal with the ringit has grown ,  and i have notbut tell me :  what do you mean by theyand who are they to bethat seems to me what this council has to decide ,  and all that it has to decideelves may thrive on speech alone ,  and dwarves endure great weariness ;  but i am only an old hobbit ,  and i miss my meal at nooncan ' t you think of some names nowor put it off till after dinnerthe noon - bell rangstill no one spokefrodo glanced at all the faces ,  but they were not turned to himall the council sat with downcast eyes ,  as if in deep thoughta great dread fell on him ,  as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spokenan overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by bilbo ' s side in rivendell filled all his heartat last with an effort he spoke ,  and wondered to hear his own words ,  as if some other will was using his small voicethis is the hour of the shire - folk ,  when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the greatwho of all the wise could have foreseen itor ,  if they are wise ,  why should they expect to know it ,  until the hour has struckso heavy that none could lay it on anotheri do not lay it on youbut if you take it freely ,  i will say that your choice is right ;  and though all the mighty elf - friends of old ,  hador ,  and h˙rin ,  and t˙rin ,  and beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among themit is hardly possible to separate you from him ,  even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are notchapter 3            the ring goes south     later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbo ' s roommerry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the council ,  and had been chosen as frodo ' s companionyou are not thinking what you are saying :  condemned to go on this hopeless journey ,  a rewardyesterday i dreamed that my task was done ,  and i could rest here ,  a long while ,  perhaps for goodbut we are envying sam ,  not youif you have to go ,  then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind ,  even in rivendellwe have come a long way with you and been through some stiff timeswe want to go oni shall go ,  unless they chain me upthere must be someone with intelligence in the partynothing is decided yetyou were shut up for hourseven old gandalfi think legolas ' s bit of news about gollum caught even him on the hop ,  though he passed it offi had already heard of it from gwaihirif you want to know ,  the only real eye - openers ,  as you put it ,  were you and frodo ;  and i was the only one that was not surprisedi was afraid all the time that it might come to that ,  if i was let offbut if you ask me ,  elrond will send out a fair number ,  when the reports come inhave they started yet ,  gandalfmore will go tomorrowelrond is sending elves ,  and they will get in touch with the rangers ,  and maybe with thranduil ' s folk in mirkwoodand aragorn has gone with elrond ' s sonswe shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is madeso cheer up ,  frodoyou will probably make quite a long stay herea funny way of honouring it ,  i can ' t help thinkingnot the day i should have chosen for letting the ss into bag endbut there it is :  you can ' t wait now fill spring ;  and you can ' t go till the reports come backwhen winter first begins to bite            and stones crack in the frosty night ,            when pools are black and trees are bare ,              ' tis evil in the wild to farebut that i am afraid will be just your luckwe hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked ,  and so made for a while less dangerous ;  but we must find out for certainin the meantime you should try and forget your troubles ,  frodoi do not know if i can do anything to help you ;  but i will whisper this in your earssomeone said that intelligence would be needed in the partyhe was righti think i shall come with youdo not count on anything yetin this matter elrond will have much to say ,  and your friend the striderwhich reminds me ,  i want to see elrondi must be offi can ' t count days in rivendell ,  '  said bilbowe can have many a good talkwhat about helping me with my book ,  and making a start on the nexthave you thought of an endinghow would this do :  and they all settled down and lived together happily ever afterthat ' s what i often wonderthe future ,  good or ill ,  was not forgotten ,  but ceased to have any power over the presenthealth and hope grew strong in them ,  and they were content with each good day as it came ,  taking pleasure in every meal ,  and in every word and songso the days slipped away ,  as each morning dawned bright and fair ,  and each evening followed cool and clearbut autumn was waning fast ;  slowly the golden light faded to pale silver ,  and the lingering leaves fell from the naked treesa wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the eastthe hunter ' s moon waxed round in the night sky ,  and put to flight all the lesser starsbut low in the south one star shone redevery night ,  as the moon waned again ,  it shone brighter and brighterfrodo could see it from his window ,  deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valleythe hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of elrond ,  and november had gone by with the last shreds of autumn ,  and december was passing ,  when the scouts began to returnsome had gone north beyond the springs of the hoarwell into the ettenmoors ;  and others had gone west ,  and with the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the lands far down the greyflood ,  as far as tharbad ,  where the old north road crossed the river by a ruined townmany had gone east and south ;  and some of these had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood ,  while others had climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river ,  and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobelradagast was not there ;  and they had returned over the high pass that was called the dimrill stairthe sons of elrond ,  elladan and elrohir ,  were the last to return ;  they had made a great journey ,  passing down the silverlode into a strange country ,  but of their errand they would not speak to any save to elrondin no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the riders or other servants of the enemyeven from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no fresh newsnothing had been seen or heard of gollum ;  but the wild wolves were still gathering ,  and were hunting again far up the great riverthree of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded fordon the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more ,  and also a long black cloak ,  slashed and tatteredof the black riders no other trace was to be seen ,  and nowhere was their presence to be feltit seemed that they had vanished from the northof course the enemy has other servants ,  but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of rivendell before they can pick up our trailand if we are careful that will be hard to findbut we must delay no longerhe looked gravely at frodobut those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or forcethey must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aiddo you still hold to your word ,  frodo ,  that you will be the ring - bearerthe shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains ,  and draws nigh even to the borders of greyflood ;  and under the shadow all is dark to meyou will meet many foes ,  some open ,  and some disguised ;  and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for iti will send out messages ,  such as i can contrive ,  to those whom i know in the wide world ;  but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry ,  or come no quicker than you yourselfthe number must be few ,  since your hope is in speed and secrecyhad i a host of elves in armour of the elder days ,  it would avail little ,  save to arouse the power of mordorwith you and your faithful servant ,  gandalf will go ;  for this shall be his great task ,  and maybe the end of his labourslegolas shall be for the elves ;  and gimli son of glûin for the dwarvesthey are willing to go at least to the passes of the mountains ,  and maybe beyondfor men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn ,  for the ring of isildur concerns him closelybut your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of milestherefore boromir will also be in the companyhe is a valiant manof my household i may find some that it seems good to me to sendwe want to go with frodoit is true that if these hobbits understood the danger ,  they would not dare to gobut they would still wish to go ,  or wish that they dared ,  and be shamed and unhappyi think ,  elrond ,  that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdomeven if you chose for us an elf - lord ,  such as glorfindel ,  he could not storm the dark tower ,  nor open the road to the fire by the power that is in himthe shire ,  i forebode ,  is not free now from peril ;  and these two i had thought to send back there as messengers ,  to do what they could ,  according to the fashion of their country ,  to warn the people of their dangerin any case ,  i judge that the younger of these two ,  peregrin took ,  should remainmy heart is against his goingyou shall go ,  '  said elrond ,  and he sighedin seven days the company must departvery bright was that sword when it was made whole again ;  the light of the sun shone redly in it ,  and the light of the moon shone cold ,  and its edge was hard and keenand aragorn gave it a new name and called it and˙ril ,  flame of the westaragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet ;  and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of elrondsometimes frodo was with them ;  but he was content to lean on their guidance ,  and he spent as much time as he could with bilboin those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the hall of fire ,  and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren and l˙thien and the winning of the great jewel ;  but in the day ,  while merry and pippin were out and about ,  frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo in his own small roomthen bilbo would read passages from his book  ( which still seemed very incomplete )or scraps of his verses ,  or would take notes of frodo ' s adventureson the morning of the last day frodo was alone with bilbo ,  and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden boxhe lifted the lid and fumbled insidei took it to keep it safe but i ' ve forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend itno

  of times there were before ,            i listen for returning feet            and voices at the doorit was a cold grey day near the end of decemberthe east wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees ,  and seething in the dark pines on the hillsragged clouds were hurrying overhead ,  dark and lowas the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made ready to set outthey were to start at dusk ,  for elrond counselled them to journey under cover of night as often as they could ,  until they were far from rivendellsoon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern landseven of the sky above you must beware as you go on your wayaragorn had and˙ril but no other weapon ,  and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brownas a ranger of the wildernessboromir had a long sword ,  in fashion like and˙ril but of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war - hornslow should you be to wind that horn again ,  boromir ,  said elrondlegolas had a bow and a quiver ,  and at his belt a long white knifethe younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow ;  but frodo took only sting ;  and his mail - coat ,  as bilbo wished ,  remained hiddengandalf bore his staff ,  but girt at his side was the elven - sword glamdring ,  the mate of orcrist that lay now upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountainall were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes ,  and they had jackets and cloaks lined with furspare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony ,  none other than the poor beast that they had brought from breehe stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him :  he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youthit was sam who had insisted on choosing him ,  declaring that bill  ( as he called him )  would pine ,  if he did not comehe gave me a look as plain as mrpippin could speak it :  if you don ' t let me go with you ,  sam ,  i ' ll follow on my owntheir farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire ,  and they were only waiting now for gandalf ,  who had not yet come out of the housea gleam of firelight came from the open doors ,  and soft lights were glowing in many windowsbilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodoaragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees ;  only elrond knew fully what this hour meant to himthe others could be seen as grey shapes in the darknesssam was standing by the pony ,  sucking his teeth ,  and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below ;  his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebbyou could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comessam eased the pack on his shoulders ,  and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it ,  wondering if he had forgotten anything :  his chief treasure ,  his cooking gear ;  and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could ;  a good supply of pipe - weed  ( but not near enough ,  i ' ll warrant )  ;  flint and tinder ;  woollen hose :  linen ;  various small belongings of his master ' s that frodo had forgotten and sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called forhe went through them alland only last night you said to yourself :   " sam ,  what about a bit of ropeyou ' ll want it ,  if you haven ' t got it :  "  well ,  i ' ll want iti can ' t get it nowon him alone is any charge laid :  neither to cast away the ring ,  nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it ,  save members of the company and the council ,  and only then in gravest needthe others go with him as free companions ,  to help him on his wayyou may tarry ,  or come back ,  or turn aside into other paths ,  as chance allowsthe further you go ,  the less easy will it be to withdraw ;  yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you willfor you do not yet know the strength of your hearts ,  and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the roadbut go now with good heartsfarewell ,  and may the blessing of elves and men and all free folk go with youmay the stars shine upon your facesand don ' t be too longthere was no laughter ,  and no song or musicat last they turned away and faded silently into the duskthey crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of rivendell ;  and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heatherthen with one glance at the last homely house twinkling below them they strode away far into the nightat the ford of bruinen they left the road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded landstheir purpose was to hold this course west of the mountains for many miles and daysthe country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the great river in wilderland on the other side of the range ,  and their going would be slow ;  but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyesthe spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country ,  and the paths were little known except to the people of rivendellgandalf walked in front ,  and with him went aragorn ,  who knew this land even in the darkthe others were in file behind ,  and legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguardthe first part of their journey was hard and dreary ,  and frodo remembered little of it ,  save the windfor many sunless days an icy blast came from the mountains in the east ,  and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingersthough the company was well clad ,  they seldom felt warm ,  either moving or at restthey slept uneasily during the middle of the day ,  in some hollow of the land ,  or hidden under the tangled thorn - bushes that grew in thickets in many placesin the late afternoon they were roused by the watch ,  and took their chief meal :  cold and cheerless as a rule ,  for they could seldom risk the lighting of a firein the evening they went on again ,  always as nearly southward as they could find a wayat first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary ,  they were creeping forward like snails ,  and getting nowhereeach day the land looked much the same as it had the day beforeyet steadily the mountains were drawing nearersouth of rivendell they rose ever higher ,  and bent westwards ;  and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills ,  and deep valleys filled with turbulent waterspaths were few and winding ,  and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall ,  or down into treacherous swampsthey had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changedthe wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the souththe swift - flowing clouds lifted and melted away ,  and the sun came out ,  pale and brightthere came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night - marchthe travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly - trees whose grey - green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hillstheir dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sunaway in the south frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was takingat the left of this high range rose three peaks ;  the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow ;  its great ,  bare ,  northern precipice was still largely in the shadow ,  but where the sunlight slanted upon it ,  it glowed redgandalf stood at frodo ' s side and looked out under his handfive - and - forty leagues as the crow flies we have come ,  though many long miles further our feet have walkedthe land and the weather will be milder now ,  but perhaps all the more dangerousbeyond those peaks the range bends round south - westthere are many maps in elrond ' s house ,  but i suppose you never thought to look at themfrodo has a better head for that sort of thingthey stand tall in our dreams :  baraz ,  zirak ,  shath˚ryonder stands barazinbar ,

and then  -  '      he pausedlet us be glad that the first stage is safely overi think we will rest here ,  not only today but tonight as wellthere is a wholesome air about hollinmuch evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the elves ,  if once they dwelt therethey are gonethey sought the havens long agothey did not hurry to bed afterwards ,  for they expected to have all the night to sleep in ,  and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next dayonly aragorn was silent and restlessafter a while he left the company and wandered on to the ridge ;  there he stood in the shadow of a tree ,  looking out southwards and westwards ,  with his head posed as if he was listeningthen he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talkingdo you miss the east windi have been in the country of hollin in many seasonsno folk dwell here now ,  but many other creatures live here at all times ,  especially birdsyet now all things but you are silenti can feel itthere is no sound for miles about us ,  and your voices seem to make the ground echoi do not understand itwe must stop talking aloud ,  rest quietly ,  and set the watchthe

appeared ,  and grew ,  and drove north like flying smoke in the windit don ' t look like a cloud ,  '  said sam in a whisper to aragornhe made no answer ,  he was gazing intently at the sky ;  but before long sam could see for himself what was approachingflocks of birds ,  flying at great speed ,  were wheeling and circling ,  and traversing all the land as if they were searching for something ;  and they were steadily drawing nearersam thought they were a kind of crow of large sizeas they passed overhead ,  in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below ,  one harsh croak was heardnot until they had dwindled into the distance ,  north and west ,  and the sky was again clear would aragorn risethen he sprang up and went and wakened gandalfthey are not natives here ;  they are crebain out of fangorn and dunlandi do not know what they are about :  possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing ;  but i think they are spying out the landi have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the skyi think we ought to move again this eveninghollin is no longer wholesome for us :  it is being watchedbut we will think of that when we mustas for moving as soon as it is dark ,  i am afraid that you are rightthe news :  no fire ,  and a move again by night ,  had been broken to him ,  as soon as he woke in the late afternooni had looked forward to a real good meal tonight :  something hotfor myself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort ,  and warmer feethowever ,  we are certain of one thing at any rate :  it will get warmer as we get southi thought at first that this here redhorn ,  or whatever its name is ,  might be it ,  till gimli spoke his piecea fair jaw - cracker dwarf - language must beall that day the company remained in hidingthe dark birds passed over now and again ;  but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwardsat dusk the company set out ,  and turning now half east they steered their course towards caradhras ,  which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sunone by one white stars sprang forth as the sky fadedguided by aragorn they struck a good pathit looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient road ,  that had once been broad and well planned ,  from hollin to the mountain - passthe moon ,  now at the full ,  rose over the mountains ,  and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were blackmany of them looked to have been worked by hands ,  though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak ,  barren landit was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn ,  and the moon was lowfrodo looked up at the skysuddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars ,  as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out againhe shiveredthe next morning dawned even brighter than beforebut the air was chill again ;  already the wind was turning back towards the eastfor two more nights they marched on ,  climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills ,  and the mountains towered up ,  nearer and neareron the third morning caradhras rose before them ,  a mighty peak ,  tipped with snow like silver ,  but with sheer naked sides ,  dull red as if stained with bloodthere was a black look in the sky ,  and the sun was wanthe wind had gone now round to the north - eastgandalf snuffed the air and looked backtonight we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gatewe may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path ,  and waylaid by some evil ;  but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than anywhat do you think of your course now ,  aragornhe listened anxiouslybut we must go on ;  and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountainsfurther south there are no passes ,  till one comes to the gap of rohani do not trust that way since your news of sarumanwho knows which side now the marshals of the horse - lords servesay nothing to the others i beg ,  not until it is plain that there is no other wayin the late afternoon ,  while the others were finishing their breakfast ,  gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhrasits sides were now dark and sullen ,  and its head was in grey cloudfrodo watched them ,  wondering which way the debate would gowhen they returned to the company gandalf spoke ,  and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high passhe was relievedhe could not guess what was the other dark and secret way ,  but the very mention of it had seemed to fill aragorn with dismay ,  and frodo was glad that it had been abandonedsnow may comewe must go with all the speed that we caneven so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the passdark will come early this eveningwe must leave as soon as you can get readywe shall meet bitter cold ,  if no worse ,  before we come down on the other sideit will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to deathwhen we leave here ,  where there are still a few trees and bushes ,  each of us should carry a faggot of wood ,  as large as he can bearthe pony looked at him mournfullythe twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared ,  and was blocked with many fallen stonesthe night grew deadly dark under great cloudsa bitter wind swirled among the rocksby midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountainsthe narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left ,  above which the grim flanks of caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom ;  on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravinelaboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the topfrodo felt a soft touch on his facehe put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleevethey went onbut before long the snow was falling fast ,  filling all the air ,  and swirling into frodo ' s eyesthe dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seeni wish this lot would go off to hobbitonfolk might welcome it thereno living hobbit  ( save bilbo )  could remember the fell winter of 1311 ,  when the white wolves invaded the shire over the frozen brandywinegandalf haltedsnow was thick on his hood and shoulders ;  it was already ankle - deep about his bootsi knew the risk of snow ,  though it seldom falls heavily so far south ,  save high up in the mountainsbut we are not high yet ;  we are still far down ,  where the paths are usually open all the winterhe has strange powers and many allieswhile they were halted ,  the wind died down ,  and the snow slackened until it almost ceasedthey tramped on againbut they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh furythe wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzardsoon even boromir found it hard to keep goingthe hobbits ,  bent nearly double ,  toiled along behind the taller folk ,  but it was plain that they could not go much further ,  if the snow continuedfrodo ' s feet felt like leadpippin was dragging behindeven gimli ,  as stout as any dwarf could be ,  was grumbling as he trudgedthe company halted suddenly ,  as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spokenthey heard eerie noises in the darkness round themit may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall ,  but the sounds were those of shrill cries ,  and wild howls of laughterstones began to fall from the mountain - side ,  whistling over their heads ,  or crashing on the path beside themevery now and again they heard a dull rumble ,  as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights abovethere are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs ,  and yet are not in league with sauron ,  but have purposes of their ownsome have been in this world longer than hehe was leaning on merry and frodo ,  and he was shiveringonly a little higher ,  if i remember rightly ,  this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slopewe should have no shelter there from snow ,  or stones ñ or anything elseit faced southwards ,  and near the bottom it leaned out a little ,  so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stonesbut eddying blasts swirled round them from every side ,  and the snow flowed down in ever denser cloudsthey huddled together with their backs to the wallbill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits ,  and screened them a little ;  but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks ,  and it went on mountingif they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely burieda great sleepiness came over frodo ;  he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dreamhe thought a fire was heating his toes ,  and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbo ' s voice speakingi don ' t think much of your diary ,  he saidsnowstorms on january the twelfth :  there was no need to come back to report thatbut i wanted rest and sleep ,  bilbo ,  frodo answered with an effort ,  when he felt himself shaken ,  and he came back painfully to wakefulnessboromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snowwe must do something to save ourselvesit is very preciousit is miruvor ,  the cordial of imladriselrond gave it to me at our partingpass it roundthe others also revived and found fresh hope and vigourbut the snow did not relentit whirled about them thicker than ever ,  and the wind blew louderdoubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us ,  but that will not help usat last reluctantly gandalf himself took a handpicking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment ,  and then with a word of command ,  naur an edraith ammenhe thrust the end of his staff into the midst of itat once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out ,  and the wood flared and sputteredtheir hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the firethe wood burned merrily ;  and though all round it the snow hissed ,  and pools of slush crept under their feet ,  they warmed their hands gladly at the blazethere they stood ,  stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flamesa red light was on their tired and anxious faces ;  behind them the night was like a black wallbut the wood was burning fast ,  and the snow still fellthe fire burned lowand the last faggot was thrown onthe night is getting old ,  '  said aragornboromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blacknessthen suddenly ,  as sleep was beginning to creep over him again ,  he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen ,  and the flakes were becoming larger and fewervery slowly a dim light began to growat last the snow stopped altogetheras the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded worldbelow their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost ;  but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snowgimli looked up and shook his headthe sooner we go back and down the betterit might well prove impossibleonly a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep ,  higher than the heads of the hobbits ;  in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliffthe storm had troubled him little ,  and he alone of the company remained still light of hearti cannot burn snowthe strongest of us must seek a waythough all is now snow - clad ,  our path ,  as we came up ,  turned about that shoulder of rock down yonderit was there that the snow first began to burden usif we could reach that point ,  maybe it would prove easier beyondit is no more than a furlong off ,  i guessaragorn was the tallest of the company ,  but boromir ,  little less in height ,  was broader and heavier in buildhe led the way ,  and aragorn followed himslowly they moved off ,  and were soon toiling heavilyin places the snow was breast - high ,  and often boromir seemed to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walkinglegolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips ,  and then he turned to the othersbut i say :  let a ploughman plough ,  but choose an otter for swimming ,  and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow - an elfthe others waited huddled together ,  watching until boromir and aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whitenessat length they too passed from sightthe time dragged onthe clouds lowered ,  and now a few flakes of snow came curling down againan hour ,  maybe ,  went by ,  though it seemed far longer ,  and then at last they saw legolas coming backat the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slopeshe is walking in the blue fields of the south ,  and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock troubles her not at allbut i have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feetthere is the greatest wind - drift of all just beyond the turn ,  and there our strong men were almost buriedthey despaired ,  until i returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a walland on the other side the snow suddenly grows less ,  while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit ' s toesit is the ill will of caradhrashe does not love elves and dwarves ,  and that drift was laid to cut off our escapestill ,  we have thrust a lane through the drift ;  and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as elveswe will bear the little folkthe others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind uscome ,  master peregrini will begin with youi shall need my arms '  he said and strode forwardaragorn with merry came behindpippin marvelled at his strength ,  seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbseven now ,  burdened as he was ,  he was widening the track for those who followed ,  thrusting the snow aside as he wentthey came at length to the great driftit was flung across the mountain - path like a sheer and sudden wall ,  and its crest ,  sharp as if shaped with knives ,  reared up more than twice the height of boromir ;  but through the middle a passage had been beaten ,  rising and falling like a bridgeon the far side merry and pippin were set down ,  and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arriveafter a while boromir returned carrying sambehind in the narrow but now well - trodden track came gandalf ,  leading bill with gimli perched among the baggagelast came aragorn carrying frodothey passed through the lane ;  but hardly had frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snowthe spray of it half blinded the company as they crouched against the cliff ,  and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind themthe threat of snow lifted ;  the clouds began to break and the light grew broaderas legolas had reported ,  they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down ,  so that even the hobbits could trudge alongsoon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night beforethe morning was now far advancedfrom the high place they looked back westwards over the lower landsfar away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the passfrodo ' s legs achedhe was chilled to the bone and hungry ;  and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhillblack specks swam before his eyeshe rubbed them ,  but the black specks remainedin the

deepening dusk ,  and the wind was coldgandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendellwhen they had eaten some food he called a councilbut aragorn and boromir made no signfrodo looked troubledif we go back now ,  then the ring must remain there :  we shall not be able to set out againthen sooner or later rivendell will be besieged ,  and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyedthe ringwraiths are deadly enemies ,  but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their master ' s hand againsam sank back into gloombut it is not a pleasant way ,  and i have not spoken of it to the company beforearagorn was against it ,  until the pass over the mountains had at least been triedonly gimli lifted up his head ;  a smouldering fire was in his eyeson all the others a dread fell at the mention of that nameeven to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear :      `the road may lead to moria ,  but how can we hope that it will lead through moriaif we cannot cross the mountains ,  let us journey southwards ,  until we come to the gap of rohan ,  where men are friendly to my people ,  taking the road that i followed on my way hitheror we might pass by and cross the isen into langstrand and lebennin ,  and so come to gondor from the regions nigh to the seawith him i may have business of my own ere all is overbut the ring must not come near isengard ,  if that can by any means be preventedthe gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearerwe might spend a year in such a journey ,  and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourlessyet they would not be safethe watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on themwhen you came north ,  boromir ,  you were in the enemy ' s eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a matter of small concern to him :  his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ringbut you return now as a member of the ring ' s company ,  and you are in peril as long as you remain with usthe danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked skyi see now little hope ,  if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while ,  and cover our trailtherefore i advise that we should go neither over the mountains ,  nor round them ,  but under themthat is a road at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to takein that case to enter moria would be to walk into a trap ,  hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower itselfthe name of moria is blackthose who pass the gates of barad - d˚r do not returnbut i would not lead you into moria if there were no hope of coming out againif there are orcs there ,  it may prove ill for us ,  that is truebut most of the orcs of the misty mountains were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armiesthe eagles report that orcs are gathering again from afar ;  but there is a hope that moria is still freehowever it may prove ,  one must tread the path that need chooseswe will seek the hidden doors togetherand we will come throughin the ruins of the dwarves ,  a dwarf ' s head will be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbitsyet it will not be the first time that i have been to moriai sought there long for thr·in son of thrûr after he was losti passed through ,  and i came out again alivei do not wish to enter moria a second timebut the question is :  who will follow me ,  if i lead you therei will follow your lead now ñ if this last warning does not move youit is not of the ring ,  nor of us others that i am thinking now ,  but of you ,  gandalfand i say to you :  if you pass the doors of moria ,  bewarewhat do legolas and the little folk saythe ring - bearer ' s voice surely should be heardthe hobbits said nothingsam

a knot of old and twisted trees ,  about which lay a broken circle of boulder stonesin the midst of this they lit a fire ,  for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from

,  holding his staff aloftfly ,  if you value your foul skini will shrivel you from tail to snout ,  if you come within this ringat that moment there was a sharp twanglegolas had loosed his bowthere was a hideous yell ,  and the leaping shape thudded to the ground ;  the elvish arrow had pierced its throatthe watching eyes were suddenly extinguishedgandalf and aragorn strode forward ,  but the hill was deserted ;  the hunting packs had fledall about them the darkness grew silent ,  and no cry came on the sighing windthe night was old ,  and westward the waning moon was settinggleaming fitfully through the breaking cloudssuddenly frodo started from sleepwithout warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the campa great host of wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at oncemore and more followedthrough the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his sword with a thrust ;  with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off anotherbeside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart ,  wielding his dwarf - axethe bow of legolas was singingin the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow :  he rose up ,  a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hillstooping like a cloud ,  he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolvesthey gave back before himhigh in the air he tossed the blazing brandit flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning ;  and his voice rolled like thundernaur dan i ngaurhoththere was a roar and a crackle ,  and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flamethe fire leapt from tree - top to tree - topthe whole hill was crowned with dazzling lightthe swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickeredthe last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as it flew ,  and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf - chieftainall the others fledslowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks ;  a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree - stumps ,  and blew darkly from the hill ,  as the first light of dawn came dimly in the skytheir enemies were routed and did not returnthat was an eye - opener ,  and no mistakenearly singed the hair off my headno trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill - topall were undamaged save one of which only the point was leftlet us eat quickly and gothe wind had been turning through north to north - west during the night ,  and now it failedthe clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened ,  high and blueas they stood upon the hill - side ,  ready to depart ,  a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain - topsit is not far ,  but our path may be winding ,  for here aragorn cannot guide us ;  he has seldom walked in this country ,  and only once have i been under the west wall of moria ,  and that was long agoin the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs ,  and in their midst ,  taller than the rest ,  one great grey wallit is well that i did so ,  for now we have several miles less to cross ,  and haste is neededall choices seem ill ,  and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest chancetogether they led the company back towards the mountainsthe only road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream ,  the sirannon ,  that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stoodbut either gandalf was astray ,  or else the land had changed in recent years ;  for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it ,  only a few miles southwards from their startthe morning was passing towards noon ,  and still the company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stonesnowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of itall was bleak and drytheir hearts sankthey saw no living thing ,  and not a bird was in the sky ;  but what the night would bring ,  if it caught them in that lost land ,  none of them cared to thinksuddenly gimli ,  who had pressed on ahead ,  called back to themhe was standing on a knoll and pointing to the righthurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channelit was empty and silent ,  and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red - stained stones of its bed ;  but on the near side there was a path ,  much broken and decayed ,  that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving - stones of an ancient highroadhere it is at lastbut what has happened to the water ,  i cannot guess ;  it used to be swift and noisywe must hurry onwe are latethe sun turned from the noon and began to go westafter a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on againbefore them the mountains frowned ,  but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaksat length they came to a sharp bendthere the road ,  which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left ,  turned and went due east againrounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff ,  some five fathoms high ,  with a broken and jagged topover it a trickling water dripped ,  through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and fullthere is all that remains of the stair fallsif i remember right ,  there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side ,  but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at the topthere used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the walls of moria ,  and the sirannon flowed through it with the road beside itlet us go and see what things are like nowwhen they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way ,  and the reason for the drying up of the gate - stream was revealedbehind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering goldbefore them stretched a dark still lakeneither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surfacethe sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valleybeyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs ,  their stern faces pallid in the fading light :  final and impassableno sign of gate or entrance ,  not a fissure or crack could frodo see in the frowning stonebut this way is blockednone of the company ,  i guess ,  will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the dayit has an unwholesome lookeven if there were no lake ,  we could not get our baggage - pony up this stairand poor sami wonder what he will sayi would have travelled lighter and brought no animal ,  least of all this one that sam is fond of ,  if i had had my wayi feared all along that we should be obliged to take this roadin breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest pointhow far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light ;  but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood ,  and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water ' s edge there was a rim of open groundthey hurried forward ,  for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that gandalf was making for ;  and then he had still to find the doorswhen they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their wayit was green and stagnant ,  thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hillsgimli strode forward undeterred ,  and found that the water was shallow ,  no more than ankle - deep at the edgebehind him they walked in file ,  threading their way with care ,  for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones ,  and footing was treacherousfrodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feetas sam ,  the last of the company ,  led bill up on to the dry ground on the far side ,  there came a soft sound :  a swish ,  followed by a plop ,  as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the waterturning quickly they saw ripples ,  black - edged with shadow in the waning light :  great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lakethere was a bubbling noise ,  and then silencethe dusk deepened ,  and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloudgandalf now pressed on at a great pace ,  and the others followed as quickly as they couldthey reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs :  it was narrow ,  often hardly a dozen yards across ,  and encumbered with fallen rock and stones ;  but they found a way ,  hugging the cliff ,  and keeping as far from the dark water as they mighta mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly treesstumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows ,  the remains it seemed of old thickets ,  or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valleybut close under the cliff there stood ,  still strong and living ,two tall trees ,  larger than any trees of holly that frodo had ever seen or imaginedtheir great roots spread from the wall to the waterunder the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes ,  when seen far off from the top of the stair ;  but now they towered overhead ,  stiff ,  dark ,  and silent ,  throwing deep night - shadows about their feet ,  standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the roadholly was the token of the people of that land ,  and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain ;  for the west - door was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with the lords of moriathose were happier days ,  when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race ,  even between dwarves and elvesbut i beg you two ,  legolas and gimli ,  at least to be friends ,  and to help mei need you boththe doors are shut and hidden ,  and the sooner we find them the betternight is at handfor here i fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burdenyou must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather :  you will not need it inside ,  nor ,  i hope ,  when we come through and journey on down into the southinstead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried ,  especially the food and the water - skinsafter he has come so far and allyou will have to choose between bill and your masterfrodo into a dragon ' s den ,  if i led him ,  '  protested samhe laid his hand on the pony ' s head ,  and spoke in a low voicemake your ways to places where you can find grass ,  and so come in time to elrond ' s house ,  or wherever you wish to gohe will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we havebill ,  seeming to understand well what was going on ,  nuzzled up to him ,  putting his nose to sam ' s earsam burst into tears ,  and fumbled with the straps ,  unlading all the pony ' s packs and throwing them on the groundthe others sorted out the goods ,  making a pile of all that could be left behind ,  and dividing up the restwhen this was done they turned to watch gandalfhe appeared to have done nothinghe was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff ,  as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyesgimli was wandering about ,  tapping the stone here and there with his axelegolas was pressed against the rock ,  as if listeningi can ' t see any sign of themright between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space ,  and over this he passed his hands to and fro ,  muttering words under his breaththen he stepped backthen slowly on the surface ,  where the wizard ' s hands had passed ,  faint lines appeared ,  like slender veins of silver running in the stoneat first they were no more than pale gossamer - threads ,  so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught them ,  but steadily they grew broader and clearer ,  until their design could be guessedat the top ,  as high as gandalf could reach ,  was an arch of interlacing letters in an elvish characterbelow ,  though the threads were in places blurred or broken ,  the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven starsbeneath these again were two trees ,  each bearing crescent moonsmore clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many raysit is long since i heard them ,  and i thought deeply before i could recall them to my mindthey say only :  the doors of durin ,  lord of moriaspeak ,  friend ,  and enterand underneath small and faint is written :  i ,  narvi ,  made themcelebrimbor of hollin drew these signssome dwarf - gates will open only at special times ,  or for particular persons ;  and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are knownthese doors have no keyin the days of durin they were not secretthey usually stood open and doorwards sat herebut if they were shut ,  any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass inat least so it is recorded ,  is it not ,  gimlinarvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earththe others looked dismayed ;  only aragorn ,  who knew gandalf well ,  remained silent and unmovedhow could that be ,  if you did not know how to enterbut we shall soon seeand ,  '  he added ,  with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows ,   ' you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved uselessas for your other question :  do you doubt my taleor have you no wits lefti did not enter this wayi came from the eastfrom the inside you may thrust them open with your handsfrom the outside nothing will move them save the spell of commandthey cannot be forced inwardsi can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mindbut only a few trials ,  i think ,  will be needed ;  and i shall not have to call on gimli for words of the secret dwarf - tongue that they teach to nonethe opening words were elvish ,  like the writing on the arch :  that seems certainannon edhellen ,  edro hi ammenfennas nogothrim ,  lasto beth lammenhe said in a commanding voicethe silver lines faded ,  but the blank grey stone did not stirmany times he repeated these words in different order ,  or varied themthen he tried other spellsone after another ,  speaking now faster and louder ,  now soft and slowthen he spoke many single words of elvish speechnothing happenedthe cliff towered into the night ,  the countless stars were kindled ,  the wind blew cold ,  and the doors stood fastagain gandalf approached the wall ,  and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrathedro ,  edrohe cried ,  and struck the rock with his staffopen ,  openhe shouted ,  and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle - earththen he threw his staff on the ground ,  and sat down in silenceat that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolvesbill the pony started in fear ,  and sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to himhow i hate this foul poolthe stone vanished with a soft slap ;  but at the same instant there was a swish and a bubblegreat rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen ,  and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliffi don ' t know of what :  not of wolves ,  or the dark behind the doors ,  but of something elsei am afraid of the pooldon ' t disturb itgandalf took no notice of themhe sat with his head bowed ,  either in despair or in anxious thoughtthe mournful howling of the wolves was heard againthe ripples on the water grew and came closer ;  some were already lapping on the shorewith a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feethe was laughingabsurdly simple ,  like most riddles when you see the answerthe star shone out briefly and faded againthen silently a great doorway was outlined ,  though not a crack or joint had been visible beforeslowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch ,  until both doors lay back against the wallthrough the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up ;  but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the nightthe company stared in wondermerry ,  of all people ,  was on the right trackthe opening word was inscribed on the archway all the timethe translation should have been :  say  " friend "  and enteri had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors openedquite simpletoo simple for a learned lore - master in these suspicious daysthose were happier timesnow let us gobut at that moment several things happenedfrodo felt something seize him by the ankle ,  and he fell with a crybill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear ,  and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darknesssam leaped after him ,  and then hearing frodo ' s cry he ran back again ,  weeping and cursingthe others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething ,  as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern endout from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled ;  it was pale - green and luminous and wetits fingered end had hold of frodo ' s foot and was dragging him into the watersam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knifethe arm let go of frodo ,  and sam pulled him away ,  crying out for helptwenty others arms came rippling outthe dark water boiled ,  and there was a hideous stenchup the stairsrousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but sam to the ground where they stood ,  he drove them forwardthey were just in timesam and frodo were only a few steps up ,  and gandalf had just begun to climb ,  when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff - wall and the doorsone came wriggling over the threshold ,  glistening in the starlightgandalf turned and pausedif he was considering what word would close the gate again from within ,  there was no needmany coiling arms seized the doors on either side ,  and with horrible strength ,  swung them roundwith a shattering echo they slammed ,  and all light was losta noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stonesam ,  clinging to frodo ' s arm ,  collapsed on a step in the black darknesswolves and snakesbut the snakes were too much for himi had to choose ,  mri had to come with youthere was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled ,but the doors did not openi fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up ,  and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gatei am sorry ;  for the trees were beautiful ,  and had stood so longsomething has crept ,  or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountainsthere are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the worldboromir muttered under his breath ,  but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear :  `in the deep places of the worldand thither we are going against my wishwho will lead us now in this deadly darkfollow my staffthe wide stairway was sound and undamagedtwo hundred steps they counted ,  broad and shallow ;  and at the top they found an arched passage

the upper steps ,  dim figures in the gloomafter they had eaten ,  gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of rivendelland unless we have great luck ,  we shall need all that is left before

in a direct line ,  and the road may wind muchall were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible ,  and were willing ,  tired as they were ,  to go on marching still for several hoursgandalf walked in front as beforein his left hand he held up his glimmering staff ,  the light of which just showed the ground before his feet ;  in his right he held his sword glamdringbehind him came gimli ,  his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to sidebehind the dwarf walked frodo ,  and he had drawn the short sword ,  stingno gleam came from the blades of sting or of glamdring ;  and that was some comfort ,  for being the work of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone with a cold light ,  if any orcs were near at handbehind frodo went sam ,  and after him legolas ,  and the young hobbits ,  and boromirin the dark at the rear ,  grim and silent ,  walked aragornthe passage twisted round a few turns ,  and then began to descendit went steadily down for a long while before it became level once againthe air grew hot and stifling ,  but it was not foul ,  and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces ,  issuing from half - guessed openings in the wallsthere were many of thesein the pale ray of the wizard ' s staff ,  frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels ,  sloping up ,  or running steeply down ,  or opening blankly dark on either sideit was bewildering beyond hope of rememberinggimli aided gandalf very little ,  except by his stout courageat least he was not ,  as were most of the others ,  troubled by the mere darkness in itselfoften the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful ;  but it was always gandalf who had the final wordthe mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of gimli ,  glûin ' s son ,  dwarf of the mountain - race though he wasto gandalf the far - off memories of a journey long before were now of little help ,  but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go ,  and he did not falter ,  as long as there was a path that led towards his goalthere was a pause longer than usual ,  and gandalf and gimli were whispering together ;  the others were crowded behind ,  waiting anxiouslyi have been with him on many a journey ,  if never on one so dark ;  and there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that i have seenhe will not go astray - if there is any path to findhe has led us in here against our fears ,  but he will lead us out again ,  at whatever cost to himselfhe is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of queen ber˙thielthey had no fuel nor any means of making torches ;  in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behindbut without any light they would soon have come to griefthere were not only many roads to choose from ,  there were also in many places holes and pitfalls ,  and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoedthere were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor ,  and every now and then a crack would open right before their feetthe widest was more than seven feet across ,  and it was long before pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gapthe noise of churning water came up from far below ,  as if some great mill - wheel was turning in the depthsalready they seemed to have been tramping on ,  on ,  endlessly to the mountains '  rootsthey were more than weary ,  and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywherefrodo ' s spirits had risen for a while after his escape ,  and after food and a draught of the cordial ;  but now a deep uneasiness ,  growing to dread ,  crept over him againthough he had been healed in rivendell of the knife - stroke ,  that grim wound had not been without effecthis senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seenone sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions ,  save perhaps gandalfand he was in any case the bearer of the ring :  it hung upon its chain against his breast ,  and at whiles it seemed a heavy weighthe felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following ;  but he said nothinghe gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedlythe company behind him spoke seldom ,  and then only in hurried whispersthere was no sound but the sound of their own feet ;  the dull stump of gimli ' s dwarf - boots ;  the heavy tread of boromir ;  the light step of legolas ;  the soft ,  scarce - heard patter of hobbit - feet ;  and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of aragorn with his long stridewhen they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all ,  unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen wateryet frodo began to hear ,  or to imagine that he heard ,  something else :  like the faint fall of soft bare feetit was never loud enough ,  or near enough ,  for him to feel certain that he heard it ;  but once it had started it never stopped ,  while the company was movingbut it was not an echo ,  for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself ,  and then grew stillit was after nightfall when they had entered the minesthey had been going for several hours with only brief halts ,  when gandalf came to his first serious checkbefore him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages :  all led in the same general direction ,  eastwards ;  but the left - hand passage plunged down ,  while the right - hand climbed up ,  and the middle way seemed to run on ,  smooth and level but very narrowhe held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice ;  but nothing of the kind was to be seenwe had better halt here for what is left of the nightyou know what i meanin here it is ever dark ;  but outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle - night has passedi hope those wolves haven ' t got him yetbeyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rockyou do not know what is inside yeti will go firstbefore his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a wellbroken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pitfragments of stone lay nearbut the lid is broken ,  and we must all take care in the darkwhile the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber ,  as far as possible from the hole in the floor ,  he crept to the edge and peered overa chill air seemed to strike his face ,  rising from invisible depthsmoved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone ,  and let it drophe felt his heart beat many times before there was any soundthen far below ,  as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place ,  there came a plunk ,  very distant ,  but magnified and repeated in the hollow shafthe was relieved when pippin confessed what he had done ;  but he was angry ,  and pippin could see his eye glintingthrow yourself in next time ,  and then you will be no further nuisancenow be quietthey stopped ,  and when the echoes had died away ,  they were repeated :  tap - tom ,  tom - tap ,  tap - tap ,  tomthey sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort ;  but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard againit may have nothing to do with peregrin ' s foolish stone ;  but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quietpray ,  do nothing of the kind againlet us hope we shall get some rest without further troubleyou ,  pippin ,  can go on the first watch ,  as a reward ,  '  he growled ,  as he rolled himself in a blanketpippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark ;  but he kept on turning round ,  fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the wellhe wished he could cover the hole ,  if only with a blanket ,  but he dared not move or go near it ,  even though gandalf seemed to be asleepactually gandalf was awake ,  though lying still and silenthe was deep in thought ,  trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the mines ,  and considering anxiously the next course that he should take ;  a false turn now might be disastrousafter an hour he rose up and came over to pippini cannot get a wink ,  so i may as well do the watchingi have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstormthe flicker for a moment showed his sharp noseand the puff of smokeit was gandalf who roused them all from sleephe had sat and watched all alone for about six hours ,  and had let the others resti shall take the right - hand passageit is time we began to climb up againthe passage they had chosen wound steadily upwardsas far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves ,  and as it rose it grew loftier and widerthere were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side ,  and the floor was level and sound ,  without pits or cracksevidently they had struck what once had been an important road ;  and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first marchin this way they advanced some fifteen miles ,  measured in a direct line east ,  though they must have actually walked twenty miles or moreas the road climbed upwards` frodo ' s spirits rose a little ;  but he still felt oppressed ,  and still at times he heard ,  or thought he heard ,  away behind the company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet ,  a following footstep that was not an echothey had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest ,  and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep ,  when suddenly the walls to right and left vanishedthey seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty spacethere was a great draught of warmer air behind them ,  and before them the darkness was cold on their facesthey halted and crowded anxiously togethergandalf seemed pleasedbut we are high up ,  a good deal higher than the dimrill gate ,  unless i am mistakenfrom the feeling of the air we must be in a wide halli will now risk a little real lightgreat shadows sprang up and fled ,  and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stonebefore them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall ;  its black walls ,  polished and smooth as glass ,  flashed and glitteredthree other entrances they saw ,  dark black arches :  one straight before them eastwards ,  and one on either sidethen the light went outi think we have reached them now ,  but it is night outside again ,  and we cannot tell until morningif i am right ,  tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping inbut in the meanwhile we had better go no furtherlet us rest ,  if we canthings have gone well so far ,  and the greater part of the dark road is overbut we are not through yet ,  and it is a long way down to the gates that open on the worldall about them as they lay hung the darkness ,  hollow and immense ,  and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passagesthe wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moriawhat did they do it all forthey didn ' t live in these darksome holes surelyand of old it was not darksome ,  but full of light and splendour ,  as is still remembered in our songsthe world was young ,  the mountains green ,            no stain yet on the moon was seen ,            no words were laid on stream or stone           when durin woke and walked alonehe named the nameless hills and dells ;            he drank from yet untasted wells ;            he stooped and looked in mirrormere ,            and saw a crown of stars appear ,            as gems upon a silver thread ,            above the shadow of his headthe world was fair ,  the mountains tall ,            in elder days before the fall           of mighty kings in nargothrond           and gondolin ,  who now beyond           the western seas have passed away :            the world was fair in durin ' s daya king he was on carven throne           in many - pillared halls of stone           with golden roof and silver floor ,            and runes of power upon the doorthe light of sun and star and moon           in shining lamps of crystal hewn           undimmed by cloud or shade of night           there shone for ever fair and brightthere hammer on the anvil smote ,            there chisel clove ,  and graver

harpers harped ,  the minstrels sang ,            and at the gates the trumpets rangthe world is grey ,  the mountains old ,            the forge ' s fire is ashen - cold           no harp is wrung ,  no hammer falls :            the darkness dwells in durin ' s halls           the shadow lies upon his tomb           in moria ,  in khazad - d˚mbut still the sunken stars appear           in dark and windless mirrormere ;            there lies his crown in water deep ,            till durin wakes again from sleepin moria ,  in khazad - d˚mbut it makes the darkness seem heavier ,  thinking of all those lampsare there piles of jewels and gold lying about here stillhaving sung his song he would say no morethe orcs have often plundered moria ;  there is nothing left in the upper hallsand since the dwarves fled ,  no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places :  they are drowned in waterñor in a shadow of fearsuch things they found here ,  it is true ,  especially iron ;  but they did not need to delve for them :  all things that they desired they could obtain in trafficfor here alone in the world was found moria - silver ,  or true - silver as some have called it :  mithril is the elvish namethe dwarves have a name which they do not tellits worth was ten times that of gold ,  and now it is beyond price ;  for little is left above ground ,  and even the orcs dare not delve here for itthe lodes lead away north towards caradhras ,  and down to darknessthe dwarves tell no tale ;  but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth ,  so also it was their destruction :  they delved too greedily and too deep ,  and disturbed that from which they fled ,  durin ' s baneof what they brought to light the orcs have gathered nearly all ,  and given it in tribute to sauron ,  who covets itall folk desired itit could be beaten like copper ,  and polished like glass ;  and the dwarves could make of it a metal ,  light and yet harder than tempered steelits beauty was like to that of common silver ,  but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dimthe elves dearly loved it ,  and among many uses they made of it ithildin ,  starmoon ,  which you saw upon the doorsbilbo had a corslet of mithril - rings that thorin gave himi wonder what has become of itgathering dust still in michel delving mathom - house ,  i supposethat was a kingly gifthe felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the shire under his jackethad bilbo knownhe felt no doubt that bilbo knew quite wellit was indeed a kingly giftbut now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark mines ,  to rivendell ,  to bilbo ,  and to bag end in the days while bilbo was still therehe wished with all his heart that he was back there ,  and in those days ,  mowing the lawn ,  or pottering among the flowers ,  and that he had never heard of moria ,  or mithril  - or the ringa deep silence fellone by one the others fell asleepfrodo was on guardas if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places ,  dread came over himhis hands were cold and his brow damphe listenedall his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours ;  but he heard no sound ,  not even the imagined echo of a footfallhis watch was nearly over ,  when ,  far off where he guessed that the western archway stood ,  he fancied that he could see two pale points of light ,  almost like luminous eyeshis head had noddedwhen he lay down he quickly went to sleep ,  but it seemed to him that the dream went on :  he heard whispers ,  and saw the two pale points of light approaching ,  slowlyhe woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him ,  and that a dim light was falling on his facehigh up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam ;  and across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantlyfrodo sat upi was right ,  you seewe are high up on the east side of moriabefore today is over we ought to find the great gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before usi doubt now that balin ever came hereyonder eastward archunless i am quite astray ,  i guess that we are above and to the north of the great gates ;  and it may not be easy to find the right road down to themthe eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take ;  but before we make up our minds we ought to look about uslet us go towards that light in the north doorif we could find a window it would help ,  but i fear that the light comes only down deep shaftsthey found themselves in a wide corridoras they went along it the glimmer grew stronger ,  and they saw that it came through a doorway on their rightit was high and flat - topped ,  and the stone door was still upon its hinges ,  standing half openbeyond it was a large square chamberit was dimly lit ,  but to their eyes ,  after so long a time in the dark ,  it seemed dazzlingly bright ,  and they blinked as they enteredtheir feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor ,  and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make outthe chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall ;  it slanted upwards and ,  far above ,  a small square patch of blue sky could be seenthe light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room :  a single oblong block ,  about two feet high ,  upon which was laid a great slab of white stonegandalf came quickly to his sideon the slab runes were deeply graven :       ' these are daeron ' s runes ,  such as were used of old in moria ,  '  said gandalfchapter 5            the bridge of khazad - d˚m     the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balinfrodo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf ,  and of balin ' s visit to the shire long agoin that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the worldat length they stirred and looked up ,  and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of balin ' s fate ,  or show what had become of his folkthere was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber ,  under the shaftby both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying ,  and among them were broken swords and axe - heads ,  and cloven shields and helmssome of the swords were crooked :  orc - scimitars with blackened bladesthere were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls ,  and in them were large iron - bound chests of woodall had been broken and plundered ;  but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a bookit had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned ,  and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be readgandalf lifted it carefully ,  but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slabhe pored over it for some time without speakingfrodo and gimli standing at his side could see ,  as he gingerly turned the leaves ,  that they were written by many different hands ,  in runes ,  both of moria and of dale ,  and here and there in elvish scriptat

a deep voice was raised in commanddoom ,  boom ,  doom went the drums in the deepwith a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff :  there was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outsidefor an instant the wizard looked outarrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang backfor the moment they are hanging back ,  but there is something else therea great cave - troll ,  i think ,  or more than onethere is no hope of escape that waybut it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behindwe cannot block

no chance to fly yetthere was a blow on the door that made it quiver ;  and then it began to grind slowly open ,  driving back the wedgesa huge arm and shoulder ,  with a dark skin of greenish scales

of the wizard ' s staffhe seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed doorfrodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam ,  who put his arms about himthey stood peering up the stairs into the darknessfrodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above ,  muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echohe could not catch what was saidthe walls seemed to be tremblingevery now and again the drum - beats throbbed and rolled :  doom ,  doomsuddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white lightthen there was a dull rumble and a heavy thudthe drum - beats broke out wildly :  doom - boom ,  doom - boom ,  and then stoppedgandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the companythat ' s overbut i have met my match ,  and have nearly been destroyedbut don ' t stand hereyou will have to do without light for a while :  i am rather shakenwhere are you ,  gimlicome ahead with mekeep close behind ,  all of youdoom ,  doom went the drum - beats again :  they now sounded muffled and far away ,  but they were followingthere was no other sound of pursuit ,  neither tramp of feet ,  nor any voicegandalf took no turns ,  right or left ,  for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desiredevery now and again it descended a flight of steps ,  fifty or more ,  to a lower levelat the moment that was their chief danger ;  for in the dark they could not see a descent ,  until they came on it ,  and put their feet out into emptinessgandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind manat the end of an hour they had gone a mile ,  or maybe a little more ,  and had descended many flights of stairsthere was still no sound of pursuitalmost they began to hope that they would escapeat the bottom of the seventh flight gandalf haltedsoon i think we should look for a left - hand turn to take us easti hope it is not fari am very wearyi must rest here a moment ,  even if all the orcs ever spawned are after usi could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting - spell on the doori know many ;  but to do things of that kind rightly requires time ,  and even then the door can be broken by strengthi could not hear what was said ;  they seemed to be talking in their own hideous languageall i caught was gh‚sh ;  that is  " fire "then something came into the chamber ñ i felt it through the door ,  and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silentit laid hold of the iron ring ,  and then it perceived me and my spellthe counter - spell was terribleit nearly broke mefor an instant the door left my control and began to openi had to speak a word of commandthat proved too great a strainthe door burst in piecessomething dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside ,  and i was thrown backwards down the stairsall the wall gave way ,  and the roof of the chamber as well ,  i thinki cannot saybut at least the passage behind us was completely blockedi have never felt so spent ,  but it is passingand now what about you ,  frodothere was not time to say so ,  but i have never been more delighted in my life than when you spokei feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carryingi am bruised and in pain ,  but it is not too badhad i known ,  i would have spoken softer in the inn at breethat spear - thrust would have skewered a wild boarhe found breathing painfulthey now went on againbefore long gimli spokehe had keen eyes in the darkbut it is not daylightwhat can it bestill ,  we can only go onit was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before themthey could now see their way :  in front the road sloped down swiftly ,  and some way ahead there stood a low archway ;  through it the glowing light camethe air became very hotwhen they came to the arch gandalf went through ,  signing to them to waitas he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glowquickly he stepped backbut i know now where we are :  we have reached the first deep ,  the level immediately below the gatesthis is the second hall of old moria ;  and the gates are near :  away beyond the eastern end ,  on the left ,  not more than a quarter of a mileacross the bridge ,  up a broad stair ,  along a wide road through the first hall ,  and outbut come and lookbefore them was another cavernous hallit was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had sleptthey were near its eastern end ;  westward it ran away into darknessdown the centre stalked a double line of towering pillarsthey were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stonetheir stems were smooth and black ,  but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sidesright across the floor ,  close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had openedout of it a fierce red light came ,  and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columnswisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot airthere is no time to loseaway beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn - callsdoom ,  doom :  the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiverthe distance was greater than it had lookedas they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behinda shrill yell went up :  they had been seenthere was a ring and clash of steelan arrow whistled over frodo ' s headboromir laughedwe are on the wrong sideit is dangerous and narrowat the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depththe outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone ,  without kerb or rail ,  that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feetit was an ancient defence of the dwarves against any enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passagesthey could only pass across it in single fileat the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behindstraight on and up the stair beyond the doorone struck frodo and sprang backanother pierced gandalf ' s hat and stuck there like a black featherfrodo looked behindbeyond the fire he saw swarming black figures :  there seemed to be hundreds of orcsthey brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelightdoom ,  doom rolled the drum - beats ,  growing louder and louder ,  doom ,  doomlegolas turned and set an arrow to the string ,  though it was a long shot for his small bowhe drew ,  but his hand fell ,  and the arrow slipped to the groundhe gave a cry of dismay and feartwo great trolls appeared ;  they bore great slabs of stone ,  and flung them down to serve as gangways over the firebut it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with terrorthe ranks of the orcs had opened ,  and they crowded away ,  as if they themselves were afraidsomething was coming up behind themwhat it was could not be seen :  it was like a great shadow ,  in the middle of which was a dark form ,  of man - shape maybe ,  yet greater ;  and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before itit came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over itthen with a rush it leaped across the fissurethe flames roared up to greet it ,  and wreathed about it ;  and a black smoke swirled in the airits streaming mane kindled ,  and blazed behind itin its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire ;  in its left it held a whip of many thongsa balrog is comeand i am already wearythe orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangwaysthen boromir raised his horn and blewloud the challenge rang and bellowed ,  like the shout of many throats under the cavernous rooffor a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow haltedthen the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind ,  and the enemy advanced againthis is a foe beyond any of youi must hold the narrow waythe others halted just within the doorway at the hall ' s end ,  and turned ,  unable to leave their leader to face the enemy

facing him ,  and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wingsit raised the whip ,  and the thongs whined and crackedfire came from its nostrilsbut gandalf stood firmthe orcs stood still ,  and a dead silence fellyou cannot passthe dark fire will not avail you ,  flame of ud˚ngo back to the shadowyou cannot passthe fire in it seemed to die ,  but the darkness grewit stepped forward slowly on to the bridge ,  and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height ,  and its wings were spread from wall to wall ;  but still gandalf could be seen ,  glimmering in the gloom ;  he seemed small ,  and altogether alone :  grey and bent ,  like a wizened tree before the onset of a stormfrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flamingglamdring glittered white in answerthere was a ringing clash and a stab of white firethe balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragmentsthe wizard swayed on the bridge ,  stepped back a pace ,  and then again stood stillwith a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridgeits whip whirled and hissedat that moment gandalf lifted his staff ,  and crying aloud he smote the bridge before himthe staff broke asunder and fell from his handa blinding sheet of white flame sprang upthe bridge crackedright at the balrog ' s feet it broke ,  and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf ,  while the rest remained ,  poised ,  quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptinesswith a terrible cry the balrog fell forward ,  and its shadow plunged down and vanishedbut even as it fell it swung its whip ,  and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard ' s knees ,  dragging him to the brinkhe staggered and fell ,  grasped vainly at the stone ,  and slid into the abyssthe fires went out ,  and blank darkness fellthe company stood rooted

windows in the eastthey fled across itthrough its huge broken doors they passed ,  and suddenly before them the great gates opened ,  an arch of blazing lightthere was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door posts towering on either side ,  but the gates were shattered and cast downaragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path ,  and the rest fled in terror of his wraththe company swept past them and took no heed of themout of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age - worn steps ,  the threshold of moriathus ,  at last ,  they came beyond

eastwards there was a golden light on the landit was but one hour after noonthe sun was shining ;  the clouds were white and highthey looked backdark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain

dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains ,  above which three white peaks were shining :  celebdil ,  fanuidhol ,  caradhrasthe mountains of moriaat the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls ,  and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains '  feetto the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end ,  and far lands could be descried beyond them ,  wide and vagueto the south the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reachless than a mile away ,  and a little below them ,  for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale ,  there lay a mereit was long and oval ,  shaped like a great spear - head thrust deep into the northern glen ;  but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit skyyet its waters were dark :  a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp - lit roomits face was still and unruffledabout it lay a smooth sward ,  shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rimbut we cannot linger thereit is i that must hasten away ,  and he that must remainit was rough and broken ,  fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stonesbut still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf - kingdomin places there were ruined works of stone beside the path ,  and mounds of green topped with slender birches ,  or fir - trees sighing in the windan eastward bend led them hard by the sward of mirrormere ,  and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the topthe orcs will not ,  maybe ,  come out till after dusk ,  but we must be far away before nightfallthe moon is almost spent ,  and it will be dark tonightfrodo followed slowly ,  drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness ;  sam came up behindbeside the standing stone gimli halted and looked upit was cracked and weather - worn ,  and the faint runes upon its side could not be readat first they could see nothingthen slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue ,  and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them ;  beyond there was a space of skythere like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars ,  though sunlight was in the sky aboveof their own stooping forms no shadow could be seenthe road now turned south and went quickly downwards ,  running out from between the arms of the dalesome way below the mere they came on a deep well of water ,  clear as crystal ,  from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channelit is icy coldfor i shall take you by the road that gandalf chose ,  and first i hope to come to the woods where the silverlode flows into the great river - out yonderthere are no trees like the trees of that landfor in the autumn their leaves fall not ,  but turn to goldnot till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall ,  and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers ;  and the floor of the wood is golden ,  and golden is the roof ,  and its pillars are of silver ,  for the bark of the trees is smooth and greyso still our songs in mirkwood saymy heart would be glad if i were beneath the eaves of that wood ,  and it were springtimelet us hastenthey had eaten nothing since

painful and he gasped for breathat last legolas turned ,  and seeing them now far behind ,  he spoke to aragornthe others halted ,  and aragorn ran back ,  calling to boromir to come with himyou

steep and clothed with harts - tongue and shrubs of whortle - berryat the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbleshere they restedit was now nearly three hours after noon ,  and they had come only a few miles from the gatesalready the sun was westeringwhile gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush -  and fir - wood ,  and drew water ,  aragorn tended sam and frodosam ' s wound was not deep ,  but it looked ugly ,  and aragorn ' s face was grave as he examined itafter a moment he looked up with reliefthe cut is not poisoned

it is your turni still marvel that you are alive at allthen he laughedthe silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling seacarefully he took it off and held it up ,  and the gems on it glittered like starsand the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a poolif it were known that hobbits had such hides ,  all the hunters of middle - earth would be riding to the shirei have never seen or heard tell of one so fairis this the coat that gandalf spoke ofthen he undervalued itbut it was well giveni love him more than everi hope we get a chance of telling him about itunder the mail there was a shirt of soft leather ,  but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the fleshfrodo ' s left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wallwhile the others set the food readyaragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steepedthe pungent fragrance filled the dell ,  and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthenedsoon frodo felt the pain leave him ,  and his breath grew easy :  though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many daysaragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his sidemy heart is glad to know that you have such a coatdo not lay it aside ,  even in sleep ,  unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while ;  and that will seldom chance while your quest laststhey put out the fire and hid all traces of itthen climbing out of the dell they took to the road againthey had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain - sidesdusk veiled their feet ,  and mist rose in the hollowsaway in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and woodsam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace ,  and with only one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hoursit was darkdeep night had fallenthere were many clear stars ,  hut the fast - waning moon would not be seen till lategimli and frodo were at the rear ,  walking softly and not speaking ,  listening for any sound upon the road behindat length gimli broke the silenceit is to be hoped that the orcs will be content with driving us from moriaand maybe that was all their purpose ,  and they had nothing else to do with us - with the ringthough orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain ,  if they have a fallen captain to avengehe looked at sting ,  and the blade was dullyet he had heard something ,  or thought he hadas soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim ,  he had heard again the quick patter of feeteven now he heard ithe turned swiftlythere were two tiny gleams of light behind ,  or for a moment he thought he saw them ,  but at once they slipped aside and vanishedi have thought so often ,  since we first entered morialet us hurrythe others are out of sightbefore them a wide grey shadow loomed ,  and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breezewe have come to the eaves of the golden woodalas that it is winterin the dim light of the stars their stems were grey ,  and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow goldwe are still little more than five leagues from the gates ,  but we can go no furtherhere let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behindnevertheless its folk are seldom seen ,  and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern borderwe will go forward a short way ,  until the trees are all about us ,  and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest inagainst my will we passed under the shades of moria ,  to our lossand now we must enter the golden wood ,  you saybut of that perilous land we have heard in gondor ,  and it is said that few come out who once go in ;  and of that few none have escaped unscathedbut lore wanes in gondor ,  boromir ,  if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlûrienbelieve what you will ,  there is no other way for us ñ unless you would go back to moria - gate ,  or scale the pathless mountains ,  or swim the great river all alonethey heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their rightits dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them ,  and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of treesall is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken downi will bathe my feet ,  for it is said that the water is healing to the wearylet us wade acrosson the further bank we can restand the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grieffor a moment frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feetit was cold but its touch was clean ,  and as he went on and it mounted to his knees ,  he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbswhen all the company had crossed ,  they sat and rested and ate a little food ;  and legolas told them tales of lothlûrien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in their hearts ,  of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the great river before the world was greyat length a silence fell ,  and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadowsalmost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing ,  mingled with the sound of the waterit is a fair song in our woodland tongue ;  but this is how it runs in the westron speech ,  as some in rivendell now sing ita star was bound upon her brows ,             a light was on her hair           as sun upon the golden boughs            in lûrien the fairher hair was long ,  her limbs were white ,             and fair she was and free ;            and in the wind she went as light            as leaf of linden - treebeside the falls of nimrodel ,             by water clear and cool ,            her voice as falling silver fell            into the shining poolwhere now she wanders none can tell ,             in sunlight or in shade ;            for lost of yore was nimrodel            and in the mountains strayedthe elven - ship in haven grey            beneath the mountain - lee           awaited her for many a day            beside the roaring seaa wind by night in northern lands            arose ,  and loud it cried ,            and drove the ship from elven - strands            across the streaming tidewhen dawn came dim the land was lost ,             the mountains sinking grey           beyond the heaving waves that tossed            their plumes of blinding sprayamroth beheld the fading shore            now low beyond the swell ,            and cursed the faithless ship that bore            him far from nimrodelof old he was an elven - king ,             a lord of tree and glen ,            when golden were the boughs in spring            in fair lothlûrienfrom helm to sea they saw him leap ,             as arrow from the string ,            and dive into the water deep ,             as mew upon the wingthe wind was in his flowing hair ,             the foam about him shone ;            afar they saw him strong and fair            go riding like a swanbut from the west has come no word ,             and on the hither shore           no tidings elven - folk have heard            of amroth evermorethe voice of legolas faltered ,  and the song ceasedit is long and sad ,  for it tells how sorrow came upon lothlûrien ,  lûrien of the blossom ,  when the dwarves awakened evil in the mountainsbut in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her nameand when the wind is in the south the voice of amroth comes up from the sea ;  for nimrodel flows into silverlode ,  that elves call celebrant ,  and celebrant into anduin the greatand anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the elves of lûrien set sailbut neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came backtherefore they were called the galadhrim ,  the tree - peopledeep in their forest the trees are very greatthe people of the woods did not delve in the ground like dwarves ,  nor build strong places of stone before the shadow camehe looked across the stream to the road that led back to dimrill dale ,  and then up into the roof of dark boughs abovewe have sat here beside the road already longer than was wisenot far from the falls of nimrodel they found a cluster of trees ,  some of which overhung the streamtheir great grey trunks were of mighty girth ,  but their height could not be guessedmellyrn they are called ,  and are those that bear the yellow blossom ,  but i have never climbed in onei will see now what is their shape and way of growthi cannot sleep on a perchbut you must dig swift and deep ,  if you wish to hide from orcsbut even as he swung there for a moment ,  a voice spoke suddenly from the tree - shadows above himhe shrank against the bole of the treefrodo could understand little of what was said ,  for the speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the westlegolas looked up and answered in the same languagethey have been aware of us for a long whilethey heard my voice across the nimrodel ,  and knew that i was one of their northern kindred ,  and therefore they did not hinder our crossing ;  and afterwards they heard my songnow they bid me climb up with frodo ;  for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journeythe others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree ,  until they have decided what is to be donelegolas ran lightly up ,  and frodo followed slowly ;  behind came sam trying not to breathe loudlythe branches of the mallorn - tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk ,  and then swept upward ;  but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs ,  and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform ,  or flet as such things were called in those days :  the elves called it a talanit was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passedwhen frodo came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with three other elvesthey were clad in shadowy - grey ,  and could not be seen among the tree - stems ,  unless they moved suddenlythey stood up ,  and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beamhe held it up ,  looking at frodo ' s face ,  and sam ' sthen he shut off the light again ,  and spoke words of welcome in his elven - tonguefrodo spoke haltingly in returneven our own kindred in the north are sundered from usbut there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies ,  and they speak the languages of

keeping watch on the rivers ,  ever since we saw a great troop of orcs going north toward moria ,  along the skirts of the mountains ,  many days agowolves are howling on the wood ' s bordersif you

for themcall us ,  if anything is amissand have an eye on that dwarfthey were out of breath and seemed rather scaredstrider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leavesthen they wrapped themselves warmly ,  not only in the fur - cloaks of the elves ,  but in their own blankets as well ,  and tried to go to sleepbut weary as they were only sam found that easy to dohobbits do not like heights ,  and do not sleep upstairs ,  even when they have any stairsthe flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroomit had no wallsnot even a rail ;  only on one side was there a light plaited screen ,  which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the windpippin went on talking for a whileand the less said ,  the sooner i ' ll drop off ,  if you take my meaningsam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyeshe could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees ,  speaking in whispersthe other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branchesat last lulled by the wind in the boughs above ,  and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below ,  frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mindlate in the night he awokethe other hobbits were asleepthe elves were gonethe sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leavesthe wind was stilla little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground belowthere was a ring of metalthe sounds died slowly away ,  and seemed to go southward ,  on into the wooda head appeared suddenly through the hole in the fletfrodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey - hooded elfhe looked towards the hobbitsthere were no more soundseven the leaves were silent ,  and the very falls seemed to be hushedfrodo sat and shivered in his wrapshe was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground ;  but he felt that the trees offered little protection ,  except concealmentorcs were as keen as hounds on a scent ,  it was said ,  but they could also climbhe drew out sting :  it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dullin spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave frodo ,  rather it grew strongerhe got up and crawled to the opening and peered downhe was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the tree ' s foot far belownot elves ;  for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movementsthen he heard faintly a sound like sniffing :  and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree - trunkhe stared down into the dark ,  holding his breathsomething was now climbing slowly ,  and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeththen coming up ,  close to the stem ,  frodo saw two pale eyesthey stopped and gazed upward unwinkingsuddenly they turned away ,  and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanishedimmediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branchesit fled as soon as i touched the tree - stemit seemed to be wary ,  and to have some skill in trees ,  or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbitsa strong company of orcs has passedthey crossed the nimrodel - curse their foul feet in its clean waterthey seemed to pick up some scent ,  and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you haltedthe three of us could not challenge a hundred ,  so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices ,  leading them on into the woodnone of the orcs will ever return out of lûrienand there will be many elves hidden on the northern border before another night fallsbut you must take the road south as soon as it is fully lightas the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn ,  and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer ' s morning was shiningpale - blue sky peeped among the moving brancheslooking through an opening on the south side of the flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breezethe morning was still young and cold when the company set out again ,  guided now by haldir and his brother r˙milfrodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree - stemsit seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful ,  for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful musicthey went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the silverlode ,  and for some way they followed it southwardthere were the prints of orc - feet in the earthbut soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadowshaldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope ,  and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bankwe do not set foot in it so far north ,  unless we mustbut in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridgesthis is how we crossmust they swimwe will fasten them above the other ,  one shoulder - high ,  and another half - high ,  and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with careof the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was sure - footed ,  and he walked over quickly ,  holding only with one hand ;  but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look downsam shuffled along ,  clutching hard ,  and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountainshe breathed with relief when he was safely acrossas my gaffer used to saythough he was thinking of gardening ,  not of roosting like a bird ,  nor of trying to walk like a spidernot even my uncle andy ever did a trick like thatr˙mil ,  who had remained on the other side ,  drew back the last one ,  slung it on his shoulder ,  and with a wave of his hand went away ,  back to nimrodel to keep watchwe allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naithfew indeed are permitted even to set foot therethe other may walk free for a while ,  until we come nearer to our dwellings ,  down in egladil ,  in the angle between the watersand i am no spymy folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the enemyneither have we done harm to the elvesi am no more likely to betray you than legolas ,  or any other of my companionsi am not the master of the law ,  and cannot set it asidei have done much in letting you set foot

and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot passyou would be slain before you saw themhaldir and his companion bent their bowsit is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled outwe will all be blindfold ,  even legolasthat will be best ,  though it will make the journey slow and dullwill haldir lead us all on a string ,  like many blind beggars with one dogbut i will be content ,  if only legolas here shares my blindnesscome ,  bind our eyes haldiryet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond lothlûrien ,  unless maybe in rivendell ,  that we dare not by our own trust endanger our landwe live now upon an island amid many perils ,  and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harpsome speak of departing ,  yet for that it already seems too latethe mountains to the west are growing evil ;  to the east the lands are waste ,  and full of sauron ' s creatures ;  and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through rohan ,  and the mouths of the great river are watched by the enemyeven if we could come to the shores of the sea ,  we should find no longer any shelter thereit is said that there are still havens ofthe high elves ,  but they are far north and west ,  beyond the land of the halflingsbut where that may be ,  though the lord and lady may know ,  i do nottell me of these havens as we walki have never been out of my own land beforeand if i had known what the world outside was likei don ' t think i should have had the heart to leave ityet i do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old ,  or the light of the sun as it was aforetimefor the elves ,  i fear ,  it will prove at best a truce ,  in which they may pass to the sea unhindered and leave the middle - earth for everalas for lothlûrien that i loveit would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grewbut if there are mallorn - trees beyond the great sea ,  none have reported itthey felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft ,  and after a while they walked more freely ,  without fear of hurt or fallbeing deprived of sight ,  frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpenedhe could smell the trees and the trodden grasshe could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead ,  the river murmuring away on his right ,  and the thin clear voices of birds in the skyhe felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open gladeas soon as he set foot upon the far bank of silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him ,  and it deepened as he walked on into the naith :  it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the elder days ,  and was  - now walking in a world that was no morein rivendell there was memory of ancient things ;  in lûrien the ancient things still lived on in the waking worldevil had been seen and heard there ,  sorrow had been known ;  the elves feared and distrusted the world outside :  wolves were howling on the wood ' s borders :  but on the land of lûrien no shadow layall that day the company marched on ,  until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early night - wind whispering among many leavesthen they rested and slept without fear upon the ground ;  for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes ,  and they could not climbin the morning they went on again ,  walking without hasteat noon they halted ,  and frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining sunsuddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around hima marching host of elves had come up silently :  they were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from moria ;  and they brought news ,  some of which haldir reportedthe marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed ;  the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains ,  and were being pursueda strange creature also had been seen ,  running with bent back and with hands near the ground ,  like a beast and yet not of beast - shapeit had eluded capture ,  and they had not shot it ,  not knowing whether it was good or ill ,  and it had vanished down the silverlode southwardyou are all to walk free ,  even the dwarf gimliit seems that the lady knows who and what is each member of your companynew messages have come from rivendell perhapslook and be glad ,  for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the naith of lûrien since durin ' s daythey were standing in an open spaceto the left stood a great mound ,  covered with a sward of grass as green as spring - time in the elder daysupon it ,  as a double crown ,  grew two circles of trees :  the outer had bark of snowy white ,  and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness ;  the inner were mallorn - trees of great height ,  still arrayed in pale goldhigh amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white fletat the feet of the trees ,  and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like starsamong them ,  nodding on slender stalks ,  were other flowers ,  white and palest green :  they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grassover all the sky was blue ,  and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the treesyou are come to cerin amroth ,  '  said haldirhere ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass :  the yellow elanor ,  and the pale niphredilhere we will stay awhile ,  and come to the city of the galadhrim at duskit seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished worlda light was upon it for which his language had no nameall that he saw was shapely ,  but the shapes seemed at once clear cut ,  as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes ,  and ancient as if they had endured for everhe saw no colour but those he knew ,  gold and white and blue and green ,  but they were fresh and poignant ,  as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderfulin winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for springno blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earthon the land of lûrien there was no stainhe turned and saw that sam was now standing beside him ,  looking round with a puzzled expression ,  and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awakei feel as if i was inside a songif you take my meaningthough he walked and breathed ,  and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face ,  frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulnesswhen he had gone and passed again into the outer world ,  still frodo the wanderer from the shire would walk there ,  upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlûrienthey entered the circle of white treesas they did so the south wind blew upon cerin amroth and sighed among the branchesfrodo stood still ,  hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away ,  and sea - birds crying whose race had perished from the earthhaldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high fletas frodo prepared to follow him ,  he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder :  never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree ' s skin and of the life within ithe felt a delight in wood and the touch of it ,  neither as forester nor as carpenter ;  it was the delight of the living tree itselfas he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform ,  haldir took his hand and turned him toward the southfrodo looked and saw ,  still at some distance ,  a hill of many mighty trees ,  or a city of green towers :  which it was he could not tellout of it ,  it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in swayhe longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green citythen he looked eastward and saw all the land of lûrien running down to the pale gleam of anduin ,  the great riverhe lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out ,  and he was back again in the world he knewbeyond the river the land appeared flat and empty ,  formless and vague ,  until far away it rose again like a wall ,  dark and drearthe sun that lay on lothlûrien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant heightin the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur ,  where long the hidden enemy had his dwellingwe fear that now it is inhabited again ,  and with power sevenfolda black cloud lies often over it of latein this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another ;  and ever they strive now in thought ,  but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness ,  its own secret has not been discoveredat the hill ' s foot frodo found aragorn ,  standing still and silent as a tree ;  but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor ,  and a light was in his eyeshe was wrapped in some fair memory :  and as frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same placefor the grim years were removed from the face of aragorn ,  and he seemed clothed in white ,  a young lord tall and fair ;  and he spoke words in the elvish tongue to one whom frodo could not seearwen vanimelda ,  nam·riîhe said ,  and then he drew a breath ,  and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiledcome with mechapter 7            the mirror of galadriel     the sun was sinking behind the mountains ,  and the shadows were deepening in the woods ,  when they went on againtheir paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gatherednight came beneath the trees as they walked ,  and the elves uncovered their silver lampssuddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early starsthere was a wide treeless space before them ,  running in a great circle and bending away on either handbeyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow ,  but the grass upon its brink was green ,  as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had goneupon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn - trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the landtheir height could not be guessed ,  but they stood up in the twilight like living towersin their ,  many - tiered branches and amid their ever - moving leaves countless lights were gleaming ,  green and gold and silverhaldir turned towards the companybut we cannot enter here ,  for the gates do not look northwardwe must go round to the southern side ,  and the way is not short ,  for the city is greatalong this they went westward ,  with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left ;  and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth ,  until all the hill seemed afire with starsthey came at last to a white bridge ,  and crossing found the great gates of the city :  they faced south - west ,  set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped ,  and they were tall and strong ,  and hung with many lampshaldir knocked and spoke ,  and the gates opened soundlessly ;  but of guards frodo could see no signthe travellers passed within ,  and the gates shut behind themthey were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall ,  and passing quickly through it they entered the city of the treesno folk could they see ,  nor hear any feet upon the paths ;  but there were many voices ,  about them ,  and in the air abovefar away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leavesthey went along many paths and climbed many stairs ,  until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmeringit was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees ,  and it fell into a basin of silver ,  from which a white stream spilledupon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees ;  its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk ,  and up it towered ,  until its first branches ,  far above ,  opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leavesbeside it a broad white ladder stood ,  and at its foot three elves were seatedthey sprang up as the travellers approached ,  and frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail ,  and from their shoulders hung long white cloaksthe others may follow as they wishit is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs ,  but you may rest upon the wayat a great height above the ground he came to a wide talan ,  like the deck of a great shipon it was built a house ,  so large that almost it would have served for a hall of men upon the earthhe entered behind haldir ,  and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape ,  in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn ,  now tapering towards its crown ,  and yet making still a pillar of wide girththe chamber was filled with a soft light ;  its walls were green and silver and its roof of goldmany elves were seated thereon two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat ,  side by side ,  celeborn and galadrielthey stood up to greet their guests ,  after the manner of elves ,  even those who were accounted mighty kingsvery tall they were ,  and the lady no less tall than the lord ;  and they were grave and beautifulthey were clad wholly in white ;  and the hair of the lady was of deep gold ,  and the hair of the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright ;  but no sign of age was upon them ,  unless it were in the depths of their eyes ;  for these were keen as lances in the starlight ,  and yet profound ,  the wells of deep memoryhaldir led frodo before them ,  and the lord welcomed him in his own tonguethe lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his facebut the end is near ,  for good or illhere lay aside your burden for a whiletoo seldom do my kindred journey hither from the northit is long indeed since we saw one of durin ' s folk in caras galadhonbut

before his chair the lord looked at them againbut maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heardelrond is far away ,  and darkness gathers between us ,  and all this year the shadows have grown longerher voice was clear and musical ,  but deeper than woman ' s wontnow tell us where he is ;  for i much desired to speak with him againbut i cannot see him from afar ,  unless he comes within the fences of lothlûrien :  a grey mist is about him ,  and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from mehe remained in moria and did not escapebut had i known that the dwarves had stirred up this evil in moria again ,  i would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders ,  you and all that went with youand if it were possible ,  one would say that at the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly ,  going needlessly into the net of moriathose that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purposebut however it may be with the guide ,  the followers are blamelessdo not repent of your welcome to the dwarfif our folk had been exiled long and far from lothlûrien ,  who of the galadhrim ,  even celeborn the wise ,  would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home ,  though it had become an abode of dragonsand the dwarf ,  hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue ,  looked up and met her eyes ;  and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understandingwonder came into his face ,  and then he smiled in answerhe rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf - fashion ,  saying :  `yet more fair is the living land of lûrien ,  and the lady galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earthat length celeborn spoke againi will do what i can to aid you ,  each according to his wish and need ,  but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burdenyet not in vain will it prove ,  maybe ,  that you came to this land seeking aid ,  as gandalf himself plainly purposedfor the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the elves of middle - earth ,  and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kingshe has dwelt in the west since the days of dawn ,  and i have dwelt with him years uncounted ;  for ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over the mountains ,  and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeatand if my designs had not gone amiss ,  it would have been governed by gandalf the grey ,  and then mayhap things would have gone otherwisebut even now there is hope lefti will not give you counsel ,  saying do this ,  or do thatfor not in doing or contriving ,  nor in choosing between this course and another ,  can i avail ;  but only in knowing what was and is ,  and in part also what shall bebut this i will say to you :  your quest stands upon the edge of a knifestray but a little and it will fail ,  to the ruin of allyet hope remains while all the company is truenone save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glancesam quickly blushed and hung his headat length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes ,  and she smiledeven if your quest did not concern us closely ,  you should have refuge in this city ,  until you were healed and refreshednow you shall rest ,  and we will not speak of your further road for a whilethe elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain ,  and in it they laid soft couches ;  then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left themfor a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree - tops ,  and of their day ' s journey ,  and of the lord and lady ;  for they had not yet the heart to look further backanyone would have thought you had a guilty consciencei hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blanketsshe seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole with - with a bit of garden of my ownall of them ,  it seemed ,  had fared alike :  each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead ,  and something that he greatly desired :  clear before his mind it lay ,  and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to othersit need not be said that i refused to listenthe men of minas tirith are true to their wordand as for frodo ,  he would not speak ,  though boromir pressed him with questionsthere is in her and in this land no evil ,  unless a man bring it hither himselfthen let him bewarebut tonight i shall sleep without fear for the first time since i left rivendelland may i sleep deep ,  and forget for a while my griefi am weary in body and in heartthe others soon did the same ,  and no sound or dream disturbed their slumberwhen they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilionand the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sunthey remained some days in lothlûrien ,  so far as they could tell or rememberall the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear ,  save for a gentle rain that fell at times ,  and passed away leaving all things fresh and cleanthe air was cool and soft ,  as if it were early spring ,  yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winterit seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest ,  and walk among the trees ;  and it was enoughthey had not seen the lord and lady again ,  and they had little speech with the elven - folk ;  for few of these knew or would use the westron tonguehaldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the north ,  where great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the company had broughtlegolas was away much among the galadhrim ,  and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions ,  though he returned to eat and talk with themoften he took gimli with him when he went abroad in the land ,  and the others wondered at this changenow as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf ,  and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their mindsas they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keenoften they heard nearby elvish voices singing ,  and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall ,  for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understandmithrandir ,  mithrandir sang the elves ,  o pilgrim greyfor so they loved to call himbut if legolas was with the company ,  he would not interpret the songs for them ,  saying that he had not the skill ,  and that for him the grief was still too near ,  a matter for tears and not yet for songit was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting wordshe was seldom moved to make song or rhyme ;  even in rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself ,  though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before himbut now as he sat beside the fountain in lûrien and heard about him the voices of the elves ,  his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him ;  yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only snatches remained ,  faded as a handful of withered leaveswhen evening in the shire was grey           his footsteps on the hill were heard ;            before the dawn he went away           on journey long without a wordfrom wilderland to western shore ,            from northern waste to southern hill ,            through dragon - lair and hidden door           and darkling woods he walked at willwith dwarf and hobbit ,  elves and men ,            with mortal and immortal folk ,            with bird on bough and beast in den ,            in their own secret tongues he spokea deadly sword ,  a healing hand ,            a back that bent beneath its load ;            a trumpet - voice ,  a burning brand ,            a weary pilgrim on the roada lord of wisdom throned he sat ,            swift in anger ,  quick to laugh ;            an old man in a battered hat           who leaned upon a thorny staffhe stood upon the bridge alone           and fire and shadow both defied ;            his staff was broken on the stone ,            in khazad - d˚m his wisdom diedfrodo ,  if you do have another go ,  i hope you ' ll say a word about his fireworks ,  '  said samthough that doesn ' t do them justice by a long roador perhaps to bilboi can ' t talk of it any morei can ' t bear to think of bringing the news to himboth of them felt restless againon frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen :  he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave lothlûrienthey ' re all elvish enough ,  but they ' re not all the samenow these folk aren ' t wanderers or homeless ,  and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us :  they seem to belong here ,  more even than hobbits do in the shirewhether they ' ve made the land ,  or the land ' s made them ,  it ' s hard to say ,  if you take my meaningit ' s wonderfully quiet herenothing seems to be going on ,  and nobody seems to want it toif there ' s any magic about ,  it ' s right down deep ,  where i can ' t lay my hands on it ,  in a manner of speakingno fireworks like poor gandalf used to showi wonder we don ' t see nothing of the lord and lady in all these daysi fancy now that she could do some wonderful things ,  if she had a mindi ' d dearly love to see some elf - magic ,  mrand i don ' t miss gandalf ' s fireworks ,  but his bushy eyebrows ,  and his quick temper ,  and his voicei ' ve often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales ,  but i ' ve never heard of a better land than thisit ' s like being at home and on a holiday at the same time ,  if you understand mei don ' t want to leaveall the same ,  i ' m beginning to feel that if we ' ve got to go on ,  then we ' d best get it overand i don ' t reckon that these folk can do much more to help us ,  magic or noit ' s when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse ,  i ' m thinkingtall and white and fair she walked beneath the treesshe spoke no word ,  but beckoned to themturning aside ,  she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of caras galadhon ,  and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed gardenno trees grew there ,  and it lay open to the skythe evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woodsdown a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow ,  through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hillat the bottom ,  upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree ,  stood a basin of silverwide and shallow ,  and beside it stood a silver ewerwith water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the brim ,  and breathed on it ,  and when the water was still again she spokebut the mirror will also show things unbidden ,  and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to beholdwhat you will see ,  if you leave the mirror free to work ,  i cannot tellfor it shows things that were ,  and things that are ,  things that yet may bebut which it is that he sees ,  even the wisest cannot always telldo you wish to looki believe ;  though i do not understand clearly what they mean ;  and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemybut this ,  if you will ,  is the magic of galadrieldid you not say that you wished to see elf - magicbut there ,  like as not i ' ll only see the stars ,  or something that i won ' t understanddo not touch the waterthe water looked hard and darkstars were reflected in itthen he gave a low gasp ,  for the stars went outas if a dark veil had been withdrawn ,  the mirror grew grey ,  and then clearthere was sun shining ,  and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the windbut before sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw ,  the light faded ;  and now he thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliffthen he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage ,  and climbing an endless winding stairit came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something ,  but what it was he did not knowlike a dream the vision shifted and went back ,  and he saw the trees againbut this time they were not so close ,  and he could see what was going on :  they were not waving in the wind ,  they were falling ,  crashing to the groundthey didn ' t ought to be felled :  it ' s that avenue beyond the mill that shades the road to bywateri wish i could get at ted ,  and i ' d fell himlots of folk were busily at workthere was a tall red chimney nearbyblack smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirrorthey ' ve dug up bagshot row ,  and there ' s the poor old gaffer going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrowi must go homeremember that the mirror shows many things ,  and not all have yet come to passsome never come to be ,  unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent themthe mirror is dangerous as a guide of deedsafter a moment he spoke again thickly ,  as if struggling with tearsfrodo ,  or not at all ,  '  he saidif what i ' ve seen turns out true ,  somebody ' s going to catch it hoti am not a counselloryou may learn something ,  and whether what you see be fair or evil ,  that may be profitable ,  and yet it may notseeing is both good and perilousyet i think ,  frodo ,  that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture ,  or i would not have brought you heredo as you willat once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit landmountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale skya long grey road wound back out of sightfar away a figure came slowly down the road ,  faint and small at first ,  but growing larger and clearer as it approachedsuddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalfhe almost called aloud the wizard ' s name ,  and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white ,  in a white that shone faintly in the dusk ;  and in its hand there was a white staffthe head was so bowed that he could see no face ,  and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the mirror ' s viewdoubt came into frodo ' s mind :  was this a vision of gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago ,  or was it sarumanthe vision now changedbrief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of bilbo walking restlessly about his roomthe table was littered with disordered papers ;  rain was beating on the windowsthen there was a pause ,  and after it many swift scenes followed that frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involvedthe mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once :  the seadarkness fellthe sea rose and raged in a great stormthen he saw against the sun ,  sinking blood - red into a wrack of clouds ,  the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the westthen a wide river flowing through a populous citythen a white fortress with seven towersand then again a ship with black sails ,  but now it was morning again ,  and the water rippled with light ,  and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the suna smoke as of fire and battle arose ,  and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist ;  and into the mist a small ship passed away ,  twinkling with lightsit vanished ,  and frodo sighed and prepared to draw awaybut suddenly the mirror went altogether dark ,  as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight ,  and frodo looked into emptinessin the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grewuntil it filled nearly all the mirrorso terrible was it that frodo stood rooted ,  unable to cry out or to withdraw his gazethe eye was rimmed with fire ,  but was itself glazed ,  yellow as a cat ' s ,  watchful and intent ,  and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit ,  a window into nothingthen the eye began to rove ,  searching this way and that ;  and frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was onebut he also knew that it could not see him - not yet ,  not unless he willed itthe ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy ,  heavier than a great stone ,  and his head was dragged downwardsthe mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the waterhe was slipping forwardthe vision faded ,  and frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basinhe stepped back shaking all over and looked at the ladydo not be afraidbut do not think that only by singing amid the trees ,  nor even by the slender arrows of elven - bows ,  is this land of lothlûrien maintained and defended against its enemyi say to you ,  frodo ,  that even as i speak to you ,  i perceive the dark lord and know his mind ,  or all of his mind that concerns the elvesand he gropes ever to see me and my thoughtbut still the door is closede‰rendil ,  the evening star ,  most beloved of the elves ,  shone clear aboveso bright was it that the figure of the elven - lady cast a dim shadow on the groundits rays glanced upon a ring about her finger ;  it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light ,  and a white stone in it twinkled as if the even - star had come down to rest upon her handfrodo gazed at the ring with awe ;  for suddenly it seemed to him that he understoodbut it cannot be hidden from the ring - bearer ,  and one who has seen the eyeverily it is in the land of lûrien upon the finger of galadriel that one of the three remainsthis is nenya ,  the ring of adamant ,  and i am its keeperdo you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of doomfor if you fail ,  then we are laid bare to the enemyyet if you succeed ,  then our power is diminished ,  and lothlûrien will fade ,  and the tides of time will sweep it awaywe must depart into the west ,  or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave ,  slowly to forget and to be forgottenyet they will cast all away rather than submit to sauron :  for they know him nowfor the fate of lothlûrien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own taskyet i could wish ,  were it of any avail ,  that the one ring had never been wrought ,  or had remained for ever lostit is too great a matter for megently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meetingyou begin to see with a keen eyei do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offerfor many long years i had pondered what i might do ,  should the great ring come into my hands ,  and beholdit was brought within my graspthe evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways ,  whether sauron himself stands or fallswould not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his ring ,  if i had taken it by force or fear from my guestyou will give me the ring freelyin place of the dark lord you will set up a queenand i shall not be dark ,  but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the nightfair as the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountaindreadful as the storm and the lightningstronger than the foundations of the earthall shall love me and despairshe stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement ,  and beautiful beyond enduring ,  terrible and worshipfulthen she let her hand fall ,  and the light faded ,  and suddenly she laughed again ,  and loshe was shrunken :  a slender elf - woman ,  clad in simple white ,  whose gentle voice was soft and sadat length the lady spoke againi am permitted to wear the one ring :  why cannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear themit would destroy youdid not gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessorbefore you could use that power you would need to become far stronger ,  and to train your will to the domination of othersyet even so ,  as ring - bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden ,  your sight is grown keeneryou have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wiseyou saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nineand did you not see and recognize the ring upon my fingerdid you see my ringi saw a star through your fingerbut if you ' ll pardon my speaking out ,  i think my master was righti wish you ' d take his ringyou ' d put things to rightsyou ' d stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adriftyou ' d make some folk pay for their dirty workbut it would not stop with that ,  alaswe will not speak more of itat length celeborn spoke of their departurethose who no longer wish to go forward may remain here ,  for a whilebut whether they stay or go ,  none can be sure of peacefor we are come now to the edge of doomhere those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open againor we summon them to the last need of lûrienthen they may return to their own lands ,  or else go to the long home of those that fall in battleindeed i do not think that even he had any clear purposeas some of you know well ,  it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between lûrien and gondor ,  save by boatand are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the enemythe way to minas tirith lies upon this side ,  upon the west ;  but the straight road of the quest lies east of the river ,  upon the darker shorewhich shore will you now takethere are some among you who can handle boats :  legolas ,  whose folk know the swift forest river ;  and boromir of gondor ;  and aragorn the travellermy people live by the banks of the brandywinethey must be small and light ,  for if you go far by water ,  there are places where you will be forced to carry themyou will come to the rapids of sarn gebir ,  and maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where the river thunders down from nen hithoel ;  and there are other perilsboats may make your journey less toilsome for a whileyet they will not give you counsel :  in the end you must leave them and the river ,  and turn west - or eastthe gift of boats comforted him much ,  not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some daysthe others ,  too ,  looked more hopefulwhatever perils lay ahead ,  it seemed better to float down the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backsonly sam was doubtful :  he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses ,  or worse ,  and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of themnow we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleepdo not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonightmaybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet ,  though you do not see themlegolas went with them ,  for this was to be their last night in lothlûrien ,  and in spite of the words of galadriel they wished to take counsel togetherfor a long time they debated what they should do ,  and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring :  but they came to no decisionit was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas tirith ,  and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemythey would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the shadow of mordor ;  but frodo spoke no word ,  and aragorn was still divided in his mindhis own plan ,  while gandalf remained with them ,  had been to go with boromir ,  and with his sword help to deliver gondorfor he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons ,  and that the hour had come at last when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive with sauron for the masterybut in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid on him ;  and he knew that he could not now forsake the ring ,  if frodo refused in the end to go with boromirand yet what help could he or any of the company give to frodo ,  save to walk blindly with him into the darknessat length he spoke again ,  softly ,  as if he was debating with himselfbut if you wish to destroy the armed might of the dark lord ,  then it is folly to go without force into his domain ;  and folly to throw awayat least ,  that is how i see itplainly boromir ' s thought was different from his final wordsit would be folly to throw away :  whatthe ring of powerhe had said something like this at the council ,  but then he had accepted the correction of elrondfrodo looked at aragorn ,  but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromir ' s wordsand so their debate endedmerry and pippin were already asleep ,  and sam was noddingthe night was growing oldin the morning ,  as they were beginning to pack their slender goods ,  elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journeythe food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes ,  made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside ,  and inside was the colour of creamgimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eyehis expression quickly changed ,  and he ate all the rest of the cake with relishyou are kindly hostsfor these things are given to serve you when all else failsthe cakes will keep sweet for many many days ,  if they are unbroken and left in their leaf - wrappings ,  as we have brought themone will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour ,  even if he be one of the tall men of minas tirithfor each they had provided a hood and cloak ,  made according to his size ,  of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim woveit was hard to say of what colour they were :  grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be ;  and yet if they were moved ,  or set in another light ,  they were green as shadowed leaves ,  or brown as fallow fields by night ,  dusk - silver as water under the starseach cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silverthey are elvish robes certainly ,  if that is what you meanleaf and branch ,  water and stone :  they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of lûrien that we love ;  for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we makeyet they are garments ,  not armour ,  and they will not turn shaft or bladebut they should serve you well :  they are light to wear ,  and warm enough or cool enough at needand you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes ,  whether you walk among the stones or the treesyou are indeed high in the favour of the ladyfor she herself and her maidens wove this stuff ;  and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own peopletheir hearts were heavy ;  for it was a fair place ,  and it had become like home to them ,  though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed thereas they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight ,  haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the gladefrodo greeted him with delightthe dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke ,  and the mountains are troubledthere are noises in the deeps of the earthif any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes ,  you would not have been able to pass that wayyour path now goes souththey themselves went silentlyat last haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill ,  and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps ,  and to the white bridge ;  and so they passed out and left the city of the elvesthen they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn - trees ,  and passed on ,  winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow ,  leading them ever down ,  southwards and eastwards ,  towards the shores of the riverthey had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wallpassing through an opening they came suddenly out of the treesbefore them lay a long lawn of shining grass ,  studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sunthe lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins :  on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering ;  on the left and east the great river rolled its broad waters ,  deep and darkon the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see ,  but all the banks were bleak and bareno mallorn lifted its gold - hung boughs beyond the land of lûrienon the bank of the silverlode ,  at some distance up from the meeting of the streams ,  there was a hythe of white stones and white woodby it were moored many boats and bargessome were brightly painted ,  and shone with silver and gold and green ,  but most were either white or greythree small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers ,  and in these the elves stowed their goodsand they added also coils of rope ,  three to each boatslender they looked ,  but strong ,  silken to the touch ,  grey of hue like the elven - cloaksand one that is long and strong and lightsuch are thesethey may be a help in many needsbut i was wondering what these were made of ,  knowing a bit about rope - making :  it ' s in the family as you might sayhad we known that this craft delighted you ,  we could have taught you muchbut now alasunless you should at some time return hither ,  you must be content with our giftmay it serve you wellenter the boatsbut take care at firstthey will not sink ,  lade them as you will ;  but they are wayward if mishandledit would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out ,  here where there is a landing - place ,  before you set off downstreamin this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowedthe boats were moved and steered with short - handled paddles that had broad leaf - shaped bladeswhen all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlodethe current was swift and they went forward slowlysam sat in the bows ,  clutching the sides ,  and looking back wistfully to the shorethe sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyesas they passed beyond the green field of the tongue ,  the trees drew down to the river ' s brinkhere and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling streamthe air was very bright and still ,  and there was a silence ,  except for the high distant song of larksthey turned a sharp bend in the river ,  and there ,  sailing proudly down the stream toward them ,  they saw a swan of great sizethe water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neckits beak shone like burnished gold ,  and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones ;  its huge white wings were half lifteda music came down the river as it drew nearer ;  and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship ,  wrought and carved with elven - skill in the likeness of a birdtwo elves clad in white steered it with black paddlesin the midst of the vessel sat celeborn ,  and behind him stood galadriel ,  tall and white ;  a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair ,  and in her hand she held a harp ,  and she sangsad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air :           i sang of leaves ,  of leaves of gold ,  and leaves of gold there grew :            of wind i sang ,  a wind there came and in the branches blewbeyond the sun ,  beyond the moon ,  the foam was on the sea ,            and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden treebeneath the stars of ever - eve in eldamar it shone ,            in eldamar beside the walls of elven tirionthere long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years ,            while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven - tearsthe winter comes ,  the bare and leafless day ;            the leaves are falling in the stream ,  the river flows awaytoo long i have dwelt upon this hither shore           and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanorbut if of ships i now should sing ,  what ship would come to me ,            what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a seaaragorn stayed his boat as the swan - ship drew alongsidethe lady ended her song and greeted themthere in the last end of egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held ;  but frodo ate and drank little ,  heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voiceshe seemed no longer perilous or terrible ,  nor filled with hidden poweralready she seemed to him ,  as by men of later days elves still at times are seen :  present and yet remote ,  a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of timeafter they had eaten and drunk ,  sitting upon the grass ,  celeborn spoke to them again of their journey ,  and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tonguethere the river flows in stony vale amid high moors ,  until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the tindrock ,  that we call tol brandirthere it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle ,  and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf ,  the wetwang as it is called in your tonguethat is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much dividedthere the entwash flows in by many mouths from the forest of fangorn in the westabout that stream ,  on this side of the great river ,  lies rohanon the further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muilthe wind blows from the east there ,  for they look out over the dead marshes and the noman - lands to cirith gorgor and the black gates of mordoryet they should not go too far up that stream ,  nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangornthat is a strange land ,  and is now little knownbut boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warningall that lies north of rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely thereof old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm ;  but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it ,  to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant yearswhen i was sent out as a messenger ,  i passed through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains ,  and crossed the isen and the greyflood into northerlanda long and wearisome journeyfour hundred leagues i reckoned it ,  and it took me many months ;  for i lost my horse at tharbad ,  at the fording of the greyfloodafter that journey ,  and the road i have trodden with this company ,  i do not much doubt that i shall find a way through rohan ,  and fangorn too ,  if need beand let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon ,  and already our evening draweth nighbut when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass ,  and chairs were set for her and for celebornher maidens stood silent about her ,  and a while she looked upon her guestsat last she spoke againbut before you go ,  i have brought in my ship gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlûrienit was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold ,  and on it were set in elven runes formed of many gems the name and˙ril and the lineage of the swordfor darkness will flow between us ,  and it may be that we shall not meet again ,  unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returningyet it is not yours to give me ,  even if you would ;  and only through darkness shall i come to itin this hour take the name that was foretold for you ,  elessar ,  the elfstone of the house of elendilwhat praise could i say moreto legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim used ,  longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood ,  and strung with a string of elf - hairwith it went a quiver of arrowsin this box there is earth from my orchard ,  and such blessing as galadriel has still to bestow is upon itit will not keep you on your road ,  nor defend you against any peril ;  but if you keep it and see your home again at last ,  then perhaps it may reward youthough you should find all barren and laid waste ,  there will be few gardens in middle - earth that will bloom like your garden ,  if you sprinkle this earth therethen you may remember galadriel ,  and catch a glimpse far off of lûrien ,  that you have seen only in our winterfor our spring and our summer are gone by ,  and they will never be seen on earth again save in memoryyet surely ,  gimli son of glûin ,  you desire something that i could givename it ,  i bid youyou shall not be the only guest without a gifti do not ask for such a giftbut you commanded me to name my desirefor none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteousand how shall i refuse ,  since i commanded him to speakbut tell me ,  what would you do with such a giftand if ever i return to the smithies of my home ,  it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house ,  and a pledge of good will between the mountain and the wood until the end of daysbut if hope should not fail ,  then i say to you ,  gimli son of glûin ,  that your hands shall flow with gold ,  and yet over you gold shall have no dominionfor you i have prepared thisit will shine still brighter when night is about youmay it be a light to you in dark places ,  when all other lights go

glittered with silverall at last was made readythe company took their places in the boats as beforecrying farewell ,  the elves of lûrien with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream ,  and the rippling waters bore them slowly awaythe travellers sat still without moving or speakingon the green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and silentas they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from themfor so it seemed to them :  lûrien was slipping backward ,  like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees ,  sailing on to forgotten shores ,  while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless worldeven as they gazed ,  the silverlode passed out into the currents of the great river ,  and their boats turned and began to speed southwardssoon the white form of the lady was small and distantshe shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun ,  or as a remote lake seen from a mountain :  a crystal fallen in the lap of the landthen it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell ,  and far but piercing - clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice singingbut now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elves beyond the sea ,  and he did not understand the words :  fair was the music ,  but it did not comfort himyet as is the way of elvish words ,  they remained graven in his memory ,  and long afterwards he interpreted them ,  as well as he could :  the language was that of elven - song and spoke of things little known on middle -

the western woodsgreat trees passed by like ghosts ,  thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the waterit was dreary and coldfrodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the river fretting among the tree - roots and driftwood near the shore ,  until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleepchapter 9            the great river     frodo was roused by samhe found that he was lying ,  well wrapped ,  under tall grey - skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the great river ,  anduinhe had slept the night away ,  and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branchesgimli was busy with a small fire near at handthey started again before the day was broadnot that most of the company were eager to hurry southwards :  they were content that the decision ,  which they must make at latest when they came to rauros and the tindrock isle ,  still lay some days ahead ;  and they let the river bear them on at its own pace ,  having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond ,  whichever course they took in the endaragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished ,  husbanding their strength against weariness to comebut he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening ;  for he felt in his heart that time was pressing ,  and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in lûriennonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day ,  nor the nextthe dull grey hours passed without eventas the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly :  the trees thinned and then failed altogetheron the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky ;  brown and withered they looked ,  as if fire had passed over them ,  leaving no living blade of green :  an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptinessthey had come to the brown lands that lay ,  vast and desolate ,  between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muilwhat pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tellupon the west to their right the land was treeless also ,  but it was flat ,  and in many places green with wide plains of grasson this side of the river they passed forests of great reeds ,  so tall that they shut out all view to the west ,  as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borderstheir dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs ,  hissing softly and sadlyhere and there through openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads ,  and far beyond them hills in the sunset ,  and away on the edge of sight a dark line ,  where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountainsthere was no sign of living moving things ,  save birdsof these there were many :  small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds ,  but they were seldom seenonce or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan - wings ,  and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the skyhere the world is cold until the sudden spring ,  and we may yet have snow againfar away down in the bay of belfalas ,  to which anduin runs ,  it is warm and merry ,  maybe ,  or would be but for the enemybut here we are not above sixty leagues ,  i guess ,  south of the southfarthing away in your shire ,  hundreds of long miles yonderyou are looking now south - west across the north plains of the riddermark ,  rohan the land of the horse - lordsere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great riverthat is the north boundary of rohan ;  and of old all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belonged to the rohirrimit is a rich and pleasant land ,  and its grass has no rival ;  but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or ride often to its shoresanduin is wide ,  yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream ;  and of late ,  it is said ,  they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of rohanthe trees had seemed hostile before ,  as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers ;  now he wished that the trees were still therehe felt that the company was too naked ,  afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands ,  and on a river that was the frontier of warin the next day or two ,  as they went on ,  borne steadily southwards ,  this feeling of insecurity grew on all the companyfor a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forwardthe banks slid bysoon the river broadened and grew more shallow ;  long stony beaches lay upon the east ,  and there were gravel - shoals in the water ,  so that careful steering was neededthe brown lands rose into bleak wolds ,  over which flowed a chill air from the easton the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussockfrodo shivered ,  thinking of the lawns and fountains ,  the clear sun and gentle rains of lothlûrienthere was little speech and no laughter in any of the boatseach member of the company was busy with his own thoughtsthe heart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech - woods ;  gimli was fingering gold in his mind ,  and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the lady ' s giftmerry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease ,  for boromir sat muttering to himself ,  sometimes biting his nails ,  as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him ,  sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorn ' sthen pippin ,  who sat in the bow looking back ,  caught a queer gleam in his eye ,  as he peered forward gazing at frodosam had long ago made up his mind that ,  though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe ,  they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imaginedhe was cramped and miserable ,  having nothing to do but stare at the winter - lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of himeven when the paddles were in use they did not trust sam with oneas dusk drew down on the fourth day ,  he was looking back over the bowed heads of frodo and aragorn and the following boats ;  he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toessuddenly something caught his sight :  at first he stared at it listlessly ,  then he sat up and rubbed his eyes ;  but when he looked again he could not see it any morethat night they camped on a small eyot close to the western banksam lay rolled in blankets beside frodofrodo ,  '  he saidfunny it was anywayit was queerall wrong ,  if it wasn ' t a dreamand you had best hear itit was like this :  i saw a log with eyesbut leave out the eyesi saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half - light behind gimli ' s boat ;  but i didn ' t give much heed to itthen it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us upand that was peculiar ,  as you might say ,  seeing as we were all floating on the stream togetherjust then i saw the eyes :  two pale sort of points ,  shiny - like ,  on a hump at the near end of the logwhat ' s more ,  it wasn ' t a log ,  for it had paddle - feet ,  like a swan ' s almost ,  only they seemed bigger ,  and kept dipping in and out of the waterfor the whatever - it - was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimlibut whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring ,  or whether i came to my senses ,  i don ' t knowwhen i looked again ,  it wasn ' t thereyet i think i caught a glimpse with the tail of - my eye ,  as the saying is ,  of something dark shooting under the shadow of the banki couldn ' t see no more eyes thoughbut i ' ve been thinking sinceand now i ' m not so surewhat do you make of it ,  mrbut it isn ' ti saw them away back north before we reached lûrienand i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that nighthaldir saw it tooand do you remember the report of the elves that went after the orc - bandi don ' t like my thoughts ;  but thinking of one thing and another ,  and mrbilbo ' s stories and all ,  i fancy i could put a name on the creature ,  at a guessa nasty namegollum ,  maybei suppose he was lurking in moria ,  and picked up our trail then ;  but i hoped that our stay in lûrien would throw him off the scent againthe miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the silverlode ,  watching us start offand that ' s what i was leading up tono need to trouble strider or the others tonighti ' ll keep watchi can sleep tomorrow ,  being no more than luggage in a boat ,  as you might sayyou shall watch ;  but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning ,  if nothing happens before thenthere ' s nothing to tell ,  or not muchi thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise ,  a while back ;  but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at nightminutes or hours passed slowly ,  and nothing happenedfrodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape ,  hardly visible ,  floated close to one of the moored boatsa long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale ;  two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside ,  and then they lifted and gazed up at frodo on the eyotthey were not more than a yard or two away ,  and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breathhe stood up ,  drawing sting from its sheath ,  and faced the eyesimmediately their light was shut offthere was another hiss and a splash ,  and the dark log - shape shot away downstream into the nightaragorn stirred in his sleep ,  turned over ,  and sat up`      ' what is itwhy have you drawn your swordhe padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodelsince we took to boats ,  he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feeti have tried to catch him once or twice at night ;  but he is slier than a fox ,  and as slippery as a fishi hoped the river - voyage would beat him ,  but he is too clever a watermanyou lie down now ,  and i will keep watch for what is left of the nighti wish i could lay my hands on the wretchwe might make him usefulbut if i cannot ,  we shall have to try and lose himhe is very dangerousquite apart from murder by night on his own account ,  he may put any enemy that is about on our trackafter that the company kept a sharp look - out ,  but they saw no more of gollum while the voyage lastedif he was still following ,  he was very wary and cunningat aragorn ' s bidding they paddled now for long spells ,  and the banks went swiftly bybut they saw little of the country ,  for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight ,  resting by day ,  and lying as hidden as the land allowedin this way the time passed without event until the seventh daythe weather was still grey and overcast ,  with wind from the east ,  but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared ,  and pools of faint light ,  yellow and pale green ,  opened under the grey shores of cloudthere the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakessam looked at it and puckered his browsthe next day the country on either side began to change rapidlythe banks began to rise and grow stonysoon they were passing through a hilly rocky land ,  and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe ,  tangled with brambles and creepersbehind them stood low crumbling cliffs ,  and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy ;  and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind - writhen firsthey were drawing near to the grey hill - country of the emyn muil ,  the southern march of wilderlandthere were many birds about the cliffs and the rock - chimneys ,  and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling ,  black against the pale skyas they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched the flights doubtfully ,  wondering if gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wildernesslater as the sun was setting ,  and the company was stirring and getting ready to start again ,  he descried a dark spot against the fading light :  a great bird high and far off ,  now wheeling ,  now flying on slowly southwardsi wonder what that forebodesit is far from the mountainsthe eighth night of their journey cameit was silent and windless ;  the grey east wind had passed awaythe thin crescent of the moon had fallen early into the pale sunset ,  but the sky was clear above ,  and though far away in the south there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly ,  in the west stars glinted brightwe are coming to reaches of the river that i do not know well :  for i have never journeyed by water in these parts before ,  not between here and the rapids of sarn gebirbut if i am right in my reckoning ,  those are still many miles aheadstill there are dangerous places even before we come there :  rocks and stony eyots in the streamwe must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftlyhe lay forward peering into the gloomthe night grew dark ,  but the stars above were strangely bright ,  and there was a glimmer on the face of the riverit was close on midnight ,  and they had been drifting for some whilehardly using the paddles ,  when suddenly sam cried outonly a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing waterthere was a swift current which swung left ,  towards the eastern shore where the channel was clearas they were swept aside the travellers could see ,  now very close ,  the pale foam of the river lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeththe boats were all huddled togetherwe cannot dare the rapids by nightbut no boat can live in sarn gebir ,  be it night or dayturn if you cansarn gebir must be close at hand alreadynow dark and ominous it loomed up in the nightor we shall be driven on the shoalsat that moment there was a twang of bowstrings :  several arrows whistled over them ,  and some fell among themone smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry ,  letting go his paddle :  but the arrow fell backfoiled by his hidden coat of mailanother passed through aragorn ' s hood ;  and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat ,  close by merry ' s handsam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle - banks that lay under the eastern shorethey seemed very nearthe river seems set on taking us right into their armsevery moment they expected to feel the bite of black - feathered arrowsmany whined overhead or struck the water nearby ;  but there were no more hitsit was dark ,  but not too dark for the night - eyes of orcs ,  and in the star - glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark ,  unless it was that the grey cloaks of lûrien and the grey timber of the elf - wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of mordorstroke by stroke they laboured onin the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all ;  but slowly the swirl of the water grew less ,  and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the nightat last ,  as far as they could judge ,  they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocksthen half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shoreunder the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breathlegolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from lûrienthen he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bankstringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned ,  peering back over the river into the darknessacross the water there were shrill cries ,  but nothing could be seenfrodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him ,  as he gazed into the night ,  seeking a mark to shoot athis head was dark ,  crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behindbut now rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced ,  sending out dark outriders into the starry fieldsa sudden dread fell on the companyeven as he did so ,  a dark shape ,  like a cloud and yet not a cloud ,  for it moved far more swiftly ,  came out of the blackness in the south ,  and sped towards the company ,  blotting out all light as it approachedsoon it appeared as a great winged creature ,  blacker than the pits in the nightfierce voices rose up to greet it from across the waterfrodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart ;  there was a deadly cold ,  like the memory of an old wound ,  in his shoulderhe crouched down ,  as if to hidesuddenly the great bow of lûrien sangshrill went the arrow from the elven - stringfrodo looked upalmost above him the winged shape swervedthere was a harsh croaking scream ,  as it fell out of the air ,  vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shorethe sky was clean againthere was a tumult of many voices far away ,  cursing and wailing in the darkness ,  and then silenceneither shaft nor cry came again from the east that nightafter a while aragorn led the boats back upstreamthey felt their way along the water ' s edge for some distance ,  until they found a small shallow baya few low trees grew there close to the water ,  and behind them rose a steep rocky bankhere the company decided to stay and await the dawn :  it was useless to attempt to move further by nightthey made no camp and lit no fire ,  but lay huddled in the boats ,  moored close togetheri liked it not at alltoo much it reminded me of the shadow in moria ñ the shadow of the balrog ,  '  he ended in a whisperi think it was  -  '  then he paused and fell silentthis night we must all be sleeplessdark hides us nowbut what the day will show who can tellhave your weapons close to handbut either it ' s out of its running ,  or i ' m all wrong in my reckoningyou ' ll remember ,  mrfrodo ,  the moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree :  a week from the full ,  i reckonand we ' d been a week on the way last night ,  when up pops a new moon as thin as a nail - paring ,  as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish countryanyone would think that time did not count in thereit was not ,  i think ,  until silverlode bore us back to anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the great seaand i don ' t remember any moon ,  either new or old ,  in caras galadhon :  only stars by night and sun by dayfor the elves the world moves ,  and it moves both very swift and very slowswift ,  because they themselves change little ,  and all else fleets by :  it is a grief to themslow ,  because they do not count the running years ,  not for themselvesthe passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long streamyet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at lastrich are the hours ,  though short they seem ,  in caras galadhon ,  where galadriel wields the elven - ringbut so it is ,  sam :  in that land you lost your countthere time flowed swiftly by us ,  as for the elvesthe old moon passed ,  and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside ,  while we tarried thereand yestereve a new moon came againwinter is nearly gonetime flows on to a spring of little hopeno voice or call was heard again across the waterthe travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weatherthe air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant seasthe rushing of the river over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closerthe twigs of the trees above them began to dripwhen the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sadslowly the dawn grew to a pale light ,  diffused and shadowlessthere was mist on the river ,  and white fog swathed the shore ;  the far bank could not be seennow perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing usand we must find the path ,  if we are to pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muiland such a course may be more perilous than it soundsthe vale of entwash is flat and fenny ,  and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and ladeni would not abandon our boats until we mustthe river is at least a path that cannot be missedleap down the falls and land in the marshesdo you not know ,  boromir ,  or do you choose to forget the north stair ,  and the high seat upon amon hen ,  that were made in the days of the great kingsi at least have a mind to stand in that high place again ,  before i decide my further coursethere ,  maybe ,  we shall see some sign that will guide usto the tall isle i will go ,  but no furtherthere i shall turn to my home ,  alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionshipit was decided that aragorn and legolas should at once go forward along the shore ,  while the others remained by the boatsaragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapidsnone have ever done so yetno road was made by the men of gondor in this region ,  for even in their great days their realm did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil ;  but there is a portage - way somewhere on the western shore ,  if i can find itit cannot yet have perished ;  for light boats used to journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath ,  and still did so until a few years ago ,  when the orcs of mordor began to multiplyif we do not return in that time ,  you will know that evil has indeed befallen usthen you must take a new leader and follow him as best you canonly two or three hours had passed ,  and it was barely mid - day ,  when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared againthe distance is not great :  the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us ,  and they are little more than a mile longnot far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again ,  though it runs swiftlyour hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage - waywe have found it ,  but it lies well back from the water - side here ,  and runs under the lee of a rock - wall ,  a furlong or more from the shorewe did not find where the northward landing liesif it still remains ,  we must have passed it yesterday nightwe might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fogi fear we must leave the river now ,  and make for the portage - way as best we can from herethe goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank ,  where there was a level spacethen the boats were drawn out of the water and carried upthey were far less heavy than any had expectedof what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even legolas knew ;  but the wood was tough and yet strangely lightmerry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flatnonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to crossit sloped up away from the river ,  a tumbled waste of grey limestone - boulders ,  with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes ;  there were thickets of brambles ,  and sheer dells ;  and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inlandone by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats ,  while the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggageat last all was removed and laid on the portage - waythen with little further hindrance ,  save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones ,  they moved forward all togetherfog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock - wall ,  and to their left mist shrouded the river :  they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of sarn gebir ,  but they could not see ittwice they made the journey ,  before all was brought safe to the southern landingthere the portage - way ,  turning back to the water - side ,  ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little poolit seemed to have been scooped in the river - side ,  not by hand ,  but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the streambeyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff ,  and there was no further passage for those on footalready the short afternoon was past ,  and a dim cloudy dusk was closing inthey sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist ;  they were tired and sleepy ,  and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying dayunless the weather changes once more and cheats us ,  we shall have a good chance of slipping through ,  unseen by any eyes on the eastern shorebut tonight two must watch together in turns :  three hours off and one on guardas soon as it was fully light they startedalready the fog was thinningthey kept as close as they could to the western side ,  and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher ,  shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying riverin the mid - morning the clouds drew down lower ,  and it began to rain heavilythey drew the skin - covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded ,  and drifted on :  little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtainsthe rain ,  however ,  did not last longslowly the sky above grew lighter ,  and then suddenly the clouds broke ,  and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the riverthe fogs and mists were gonebefore the travellers lay a wide ravine ,  with great rocky sides to which clung ,  upon shelves and in narrow crevices ,  a few thrawn treesthe channel grew narrower and the river swifternow they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning ,  whatever they might meet aheadover them was a lane of pale - blue sky ,  around them the dark overshadowed river ,  and before them black ,  shutting out the sun ,  the hills of emyn muil ,  in which no opening could be seenfrodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching :  like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemedtall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the streama narrow gap appeared between them ,  and the river swept the boats towards itkeep the boats in line ,  and as far apart as you canhold the middle of the streamgiants they seemed to him ,  vast grey figures silent but threateningthen he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned :  the craft and power of old had wrought upon them ,  and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewnupon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone :  still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the norththe left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning ;  in each right hand there was an axe ;  upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crowngreat power and majesty they still wore ,  the silent wardens of a long - vanished kingdomawe and fear fell upon frodo ,  and he cowered down ,  shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew neareven boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled byfrail and fleeting as little leaves ,  under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of n˙menorso they passed into the dark chasm of the gatessheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either sidefar off was the dim skythe black waters roared and echoed ,  and a wind screamed over themfrodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering and groaning :  `what a placewhat a horrible placejust let me get out of this boat ,  and i ' ll never wet my toes in a puddle again ,  let alone a riverfrodo turned and saw strider ,  and yet not strider ;  for the weatherworn ranger was no longer therein the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn ,  proud and erect ,  guiding the boat with skilful strokes ;  his hood was cast back ,  and his dark hair was blowing in the wind ,  a light was in his eyes :  a king returning from exile to his own landunder their shadow elessar ,  the elfstone son of arathorn of the house of valandil isildur ' s son heir of elendil ,  has nought to dreadhow my heart yearns for minas anor and the walls of my own citybut whither now shall i goit bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead ;  but soon frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ,  ever growingswiftly it drew near ,  and suddenly the boats shot through ,  out into a wide clear lightthe sun ,  already long fallen from the noon ,  was shining in a windy skythe pent waters spread out into a long oval lake ,  pale nen hithoel ,  fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees ,  but their heads were bare ,  cold - gleaming in the sunlightat the far southern end rose three peaksthe midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them ,  an island in the waters ,  about which the flowing river flung pale shimmering armsdistant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far awayin the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them ,  and watch was kept therebut it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon tol brandirere the shade of night falls we shall come to themi hear the endless voice of rauros callingthey ate some food ,  and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their waythe sides of the westward hills fell into shadow ,  and the sun grew round and redhere and there a misty star peered outthe three peaks loomed before them ,  darkling in the twilightrauros was roaring with a great voicealready night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hillsthe tenth day of their journey was overwilderland was behind themthey could go no further without choice between the east - way and the westthe last stage of the quest was before themchapter 10            the breaking of the fellowship     aragorn led them to the right arm of the riverhere upon its western side under the shadow of tol brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of amon henbehind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees ,  and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lakea little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grasslet us hope that no evil has yet come herethey set a watch ,  but had no sight nor sound of their enemiesif gollum had contrived to follow them ,  he remained unseen and unheardnonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy ,  tossing often in his sleep and wakingin the small hours he got up and came to frodo ,  whose turn it was to watchit would be well to draw your swordfrodo then drew the elf - blade from its sheathto his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the nightthe light of sting is faint ,  and it may point to no more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhawi have never heard before of orcs upon amon henyet who knows what may happen in these evil days ,  now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the passages of anduinwe must go warily tomorrowlow in the east there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burningthe rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red ;  but soon it climbed above them into a clear skythe summit of tol brandir was tipped with goldfrodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall islandits sides sprang sheer out of the running waterhigh up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed ,  mounting one head above another ;  and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock ,  crowned by a great spire of stonemany birds were circling about it ,  but no sign of other living things could be seenwhen they had eaten ,  aragorn called the company togetherwhat shall now become of our company that has travelled so far in fellowshipshall we turn west with boromir and go to the wars of gondor ;  or turn east to the fear and shadow ;  or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choosewhatever we do must be done soonwe cannot long halt herethe enemy is on the eastern shore ,  we know ;  but i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the wateryou are the bearer appointed by the councilyour own way you alone can choosein this matter i cannot advise youi am not gandalf ,  and though i have tried to bear his part ,  i do not know what design or hope he had for this hour ,  if indeed he had anymost likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on yousuch is your fatethen he spoke slowlythe burden is heavygive me an hour longer ,  and i will speaklet me be alonewe will stay here for a whilebut do not stray far or out of callsam ,  who had been watching his master with great concern ,  shook his head and muttered :   ' plain as a pikestaff it is ,  but it ' s no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just nowwandering aimlessly at first in the wood ,  frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hillhe came to a path ,  the dwindling ruins of a road of long agoin steep places stairs of stone had been hewn ,  but now they were cracked and worn ,  and split by the roots of treesfor some while he climbed ,  not caring which way he went ,  until he came to a grassy placerowan - trees grew about it ,  and in the midst was a wide flat stonethe little upland lawn was open upon the east and was filled now with the early sunlightfrodo halted and looked out over the river ,  far below him ,  to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden islethe voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boomhe sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands ,  staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyesall that had happened since bilbo left the shire was passing through his mind ,  and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of gandalf ' s wordstime went on ,  and still he was no nearer to a choicesuddenly he awoke from his thoughts :  a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him ,  that unfriendly eyes were upon himhe sprang up and turned ;  but all that he saw to his surprise was boromir ,  and his face was smiling and kindand my heart too is heavymay i stay now and talk for a while ,  since i have found youit would comfort mewhere there are so many ,  all speech becomes a debate without endbut two together may perhaps find wisdomfor i know what i should do ,  but i am afraid of doing it ,  boromir :  afraidrauros roared endlessly onthe wind murmured in the branches of the treesfrodo shiveredsuddenly boromir came and sat beside himyou need counsel in your hard choicewill you not take minewarning against whatagainst the way that seems easieragainst refusal of the burden that is laid on meagainst - well ,  if it must be said ,  against trust in the strength and truth of menbut the world is changingthe walls of minas tirith may be strong ,  but they are not strong enoughif they fail ,  what thenyet there is still hope that they will not failis it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thingso small a thingand i have seen it only for an instant in the house of elrondcould i not have a sight of it againhis heart went suddenly coldhe caught the strange gleam in boromir ' s eyes ,  yet his face was still kind and friendlyi care not ,  '  said boromirfor you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy :  of its evil uses not of its goodthe world is changing ,  you sayminas tirith will fall ,  if the ring lastscertainly ,  if the ring were with the enemybut why ,  if it were with usfor themselves they may be rightthese elves and half - elves and wizards ,  they would come to grief perhapsyet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timidbut each to his own kindtrue - hearted men ,  they will not be corruptedwe of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trialwe do not desire the power of wizard - lords ,  only strength to defend ourselves ,  strength in a just causein our need chance brings to light the  - ring of powerit is a gift ,  i say ;  a gift to the foes of mordorit is mad not to use it ,  to use the power of the enemy against himthe fearless ,  the ruthless ,  these alone will achieve victorywhat could not a warrior do in this hour ,  a great leaderwhat could not aragorn door if he refuses ,  why not boromirthe ring would give me power of commandhow i would drive the hosts of mordor ,  and all men would flock to my bannersuddenly he stopped and waved his armsthat might be well ,  if reason could show any hope of doing soit does notthe only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the enemy every chance of recapturing it for himselfif it is so ,  the boldest should pardon youbut is it not really your good sense that revoltsbut i am glad to have heard you speak so fullymy mind is clearer nowhis eyes were shining and his face eagerwe have been long in the wilderness ,  and you need news of what the enemy is doing before you make a movecome with me ,  frodo ,  '  he saidif go you musthe stepped quickly away ,  and eyed with alarm the tall man ,  nearly twice his height and many times his match in strengthi need your ring :  that you know now ;  but i give you my word that i do not desire to keep itwill you not at least let me make trial of my planlend me the ringobstinate foolrunning wilfully to death and ruining our causeif any mortals have claim to the ring ,  it is the men of n˙menor ,  and not halflingsit is not yours save by unhappy chanceit might have been mineit should be minegive it to mewhy not be free of your doubt and fearyou can lay the blame on me ,  if you willyou can say that i was too strong and took it by forcefor i am too strong for you ,  halfling ,  '  he cried ;  and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodohis fair and pleasant face was hideously changed ;  a raging fire was in his eyesfrodo dodged aside and again put the stone between themthere was only one thing he could do :  trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger ,  even as boromir sprang at him againthe man gasped ,  stared for a moment amazed ,  and then ran wildly about ,  seeking here and there among the rocks and treesnow i see your mindyou will take the ring to sauron and sell us allyou have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurchcurse you and all halflings to death and darknessfor a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down ;  then suddenly he wepthe rose and passed his hand over his eyes ,  dashing away the tearsfrodo ,  frodoa madness took me ,  but it has passedfrodo did not even hear his crieshe was already far away ,  leaping blindly up the path to the hill - topterror and grief shook him ,  seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of boromir ,  and his burning eyessoon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen ,  and halted ,  gasping for breathhe saw as through a mist a wide flat circle ,  paved with mighty flags ,  and surrounded with a crumbling battlement ;  and in the middle ,  set upon four carven pillars ,  was a high seat ,  reached by a stair of many stepsup he went and sat upon the ancient chair ,  feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain - kingsat first he could see littlehe seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows :  the ring was upon himthen here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions :  small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table ,  and yet remotethere was no sound ,  only bright living imagesthe world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silenthe was sitting upon the seat of seeing ,  on amon hen ,  the hill of the eye of the men of n˙menoreastward he looked into wide uncharted lands ,  nameless plains ,  and forests unexplorednorthward he looked ,  and the great river lay like a ribbon beneath him ,  and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teethwestward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohan ;  and orthanc ,  the pinnacle of isengard ,  like a black spikesouthward he looked ,  and below his very feet the great river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of rauros into a foaming pit ;  a glimmering rainbow played upon the fumeand ethir anduin he saw ,  the mighty delta of the river ,  and myriads of sea - birds whirling like a white dust in the sun ,  and beneath them a green and silver sea ,  rippling in endless linesbut everywhere he looked he saw the signs of warthe misty mountains were crawling like anthills :  orcs were issuing out of a thousand holesunder the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of elves and men and fell beaststhe land of the beornings was aflame ;  a cloud was over moria ;  smoke rose on the borders of lûrienhorsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan ;  wolves poured from isengardfrom the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea ;  and out of the east men were moving endlessly :  swordsmen ,  spearmen ,  bowmen upon horses ,  chariots of chieftains and laden wainsall the power of the dark lord was in motionthen turning south again he beheld minas tirithfar away it seemedand beautiful :  white - walled ,  many - towered ,  proud and fair upon its mountain - seat ;  its battlements glittered with steel ,  and its turrets were bright with many bannershope leaped in his heartbut against minas tirith was set another fortress ,  greater and more strongthither ,  eastward ,  unwilling his eye was drawnit passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath ,  the grinning gates of minas morguland the haunted mountains ,  and it looked upon gorgoroth ,  the valley of terror in the land of mordordarkness lay there under the sunfire glowed amid the smokemount doom was burning ,  and a great reek risingthen at last his gaze was held :  wall upon wall ,  battlement upon battlement ,  black ,  immeasurably strong ,  mountain of iron ,  gate of steel ,  tower of adamant ,  he saw it :  barad - d˚r ,  fortress of sauronall hope left himand suddenly he felt the eyethere was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleephe knew that it had become aware of his gazea fierce eager will was thereit leaped towards him ;  almost like a finger he felt it ,  searching for himvery soon it would nail him down ,  know just exactly where he wasamon lhaw it touchedit glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the seat ,  crouching ,  covering his head with his grey hoodhe heard himself crying out :  never ,  neveror was it :  verily i come ,  i come to youhe could not tellthen as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought :  take it offtake it offfool ,  take it offtake off the ringthe two powers strove in himfor a moment ,  perfectly balanced between their piercing points ,  he writhed ,  tormentedsuddenly he was aware of himself againfrodo ,  neither the voice nor the eye :  free to choose ,  and with one remaining instant in which to do sohe took the ring off his fingerhe was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seata black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him ;  it missed amon hen and groped out west ,  and fadedthen all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every treefrodo rose to his feeta great weariness was on him ,  but his will was firm and his heart lighterhe spoke aloud to himselfi will go alonesome i cannot trust ,  and those i can trust are too dear to me :  poor old sam ,  and merry and pippinstrider ,  too :  his heart yearns for minas tirith ,  and he will be needed there ,  now boromir has fallen into evili will go alonethen he halted ,  listeninghe thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore belowhours ,  i should thinki shan ' t get a chance againi hate leaving them ,  and like this without any explanationbut surely they will understandand what else can i dohe vanished and passed down the hill ,  less than a rustle of the windthe others remained long by the river - sidefor some time they had been silent ,  moving restlessly about ;  but now they were sitting in a circle ,  and they were talkingevery now and again they made efforts to speak of other things ,  of their long road and many adventures ;  they questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient history ,  and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border - land of the emyn muil :  the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and hen ,  and the great stair beside the falls of raurosbut always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ringwhat would frodo choose to dowhy was he hesitatingit is now more hopeless than ever for the company to go east ,  since we have been tracked by gollum ,  and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayedbut minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and the destruction of the burdenor to hold off the full might of the enemy when he comes to take itwhich way would any of us choose in frodo ' s placei do not knownow indeed we miss gandalf mostwhy cannot we decide ,  and so help frodolet us call him back and then votei should vote for minas tirithhard was my parting from lothlûrienyet i have come so far ,  and i say this :  now we have reached the last choice ,  it is clear to me that i cannot leave frodoi would choose minas tirith ,  but if he does not ,  then i follow himthat venture is desperate :  as much so for eight as for three or two ,  or one aloneif you would let me choose ,  then i should appoint three companions :  sam ,  who could not bear it otherwise ;  and gimli ;  and myselfboromir will return to his own city ,  where his father and his people need him ;  and with him the others should go ,  or at least meriadoc and peregrin ,  if legolas is not willing to leave uspippin and i always intended to go wherever he went ,  and we still dobut we did not realize what that would meanit seemed different so far away ,  in the shire or in rivendellit would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordorwhy can ' t we stop himhe knows we shan ' t agree to his going eastand he doesn ' t like to ask anyone to go with him ,  poor old fellowimagine it :  going off to mordor alonehe ought to know that if we can ' t stop him ,  we shan ' t leave himhe isn ' t hesitating about which way to goof course notwhat ' s the good of minas tirith anywayto him ,  i mean ,  begging your pardon ,  master boromir ,  '  he added ,  and turnedit was then that they discovered that boromir ,  who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle ,  was no longer therebut anyway he ' s not in this businesshe ' s off to his home ,  as he always said ;  and no blame to himfrodo ,  he knows he ' s got to find the cracks of doom ,  if he canbut he ' s afraidnow it ' s come to the point ,  he ' s just plain terrifiedthat ' s what his trouble isof course he ' s had a bit of schooling ,  so to speak - we all have - since we left home ,  or he ' d be so terrified he ' d just fling the ring in the river and boltbut he ' s still too frightened to startand he isn ' t worrying about us either :  whether we ' ll go along with him or nohe knows we mean tothat ' s another thing that ' s bothering himif he screws himself up to go ,  he ' ll want to go alonemark my wordswe ' re going to have trouble when he comes backfor he ' ll screw himself up all right ,  as sure as his name ' s bagginsdon ' t let him goi do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or the othernor do i think that we should succeed ,  if we triedthere are other powers at work far strongerand let us get it over ,  '  said pippinsurely the time is upthe morning is wearing awaywe must call for himhe came out from the trees and walked towards them without speakinghis face looked grim and sadhe paused as if counting those that were present ,  and then sat down aloof ,  with his eyes on the groundi urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go easti grew angry and he left mehe vanishedi have never seen such a thing happen beforethough i have heard of it in taleshe must have put the ring oni could not find him againi thought he would return to youwhy should mrfrodo put the thing onhe didn ' t ought to have ;  and if he has ,  goodness knows what may have happenedwhere is hei have wandered for some time sincei do not knowi do not knowthey took no notice of himsam had dashed off firstmerry and pippin had followed ,  and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore ,  shouting :  frodoin their clear ,  high hobbit - voiceslegolas and gimli were runninga sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the companyi do not know what part you have played in this mischief ,  but help nowgo after those two young hobbits ,  and guard them at the least ,  even if you cannot find frodocome back to this spot ,  if you find him ,  or any traces of himi shall return soonjust as he reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him ,  toiling uphill ,  panting and calling ,  frodothere is mischief abouti am going to the top ,  to the seat of amon hen ,  to see what may be seenit is as my heart guessed ,  frodo went this wayfollow me ,  and keep your eyes opensam did his best ,  but he could not keep up with strider the ranger ,  and soon fell behindhe had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight aheadsam stopped and puffedsuddenly he clapped his hand to his headlet me see nowboromir isn ' t lying ,  that ' s not his way ;  but he hasn ' t told us everythingsomething scared mrfrodo badlyhe screwed himself up to the point ,  suddenhe made up his mind at last to gonot without samyes ,  without even his samthat ' s hard ,  cruel hardhe can ' t fly across rivers ,  and he can ' t jump waterfallshe ' s got no gearso he ' s got to get back to the boatsback to the boatsback to the boats ,  sam ,  like lightninghe fell and cut his kneesup he got and ran onhe came to the edge of the lawn of parth galen by the shore ,  where the boats were drawn up out of the waterno one was therethere seemed to be cries in the woods behind ,  but he did not heed themhe stood gazing for a momentstock - still ,  gapinga boat was sliding down the bank all by itselfwith a shout sam raced across the grassthe boat slipped into the waterhe missed it by a yardwith a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift watergurgling he went under ,  and the river closed over his curly headan exclamation of dismay came from the empty boata paddle swirled and the boat put aboutfrodo was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he came up ,  bubbling and strugglingfear was staring in his round brown eyesi can ' t see your handdon ' t pinch ,  ladi won ' t let you gotread water and don ' t flounder ,  or you ' ll upset the boatthere now ,  get hold of the side ,  and let me use the paddleand sam was able to scramble out ,  wet as a water - ratfrodo took off the ring and stepped ashore againfrodo ,  that ' s hardif i hadn ' t a guessed right ,

frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest togetherfrodo paddled away from the shore ,  and the river bore them swiftly awaydown the western arm ,  and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandirthe roar of the great falls drew nearereven with such help as sam could give ,  it was hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shoreat length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhawthere they found a shelving shore ,  and they drew the boat out ,  high above the water ,  and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulderthen shouldering their burdens ,  they set off ,  seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of the emyn muil ,  and down into the land of shadowhere ends the first part of the history of the war of the ringthe second part is calledthe two towers ,  since the events recounted in it are dominated byorthanc ,  the citadel of saruman ,  and the fortress ofminas morgul that guards the secret entrance to mordor ;  it tells of the deeds and perils of all the members of the now sundered fellowship ,  until the coming of the great darknessthe third part tells of the last defence against the shadow ,  and the end of the mission of the ring - bearer inthe return of the king
